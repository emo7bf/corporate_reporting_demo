the positive results of this focused effort.  
Annually, we survey our top 80%-spend suppliers, 
requesting information on their GHG goals and their 
emissions data. In fiscal 2024, 183 suppliers responded 
to the survey, of which 109 provided Scope 1 and 2 site-
level data for Applied supplier sites. More than  
half of the respondents, 97, said they have adopted  
GHG reduction goals, including 23 with approved 
science-based targets.  
Applied continues to collaborate with suppliers, 
using their provided survey data, to help them create 
emissions-reduction plans. We also engage a third  
party to help them calculate their emissions data. In 
2024, we began one-on-one conversations with our 
major suppliers to discuss our net zero aspirations and review their ability to transition their facility

We want to provide fair labor conditions and social 
protection for all our employees, regardless of their 
location and whether they are on fixed or temporary 
contracts. We support the principles of the International 
Labor Organization (ILO) and we respect the rights of all 
employees to form and join trade unions of their own 
choosing, to bargain collectively and to engage in 
peaceful assembly.
We have no indication that we operate in countries where 
the freedom of association and collective bargaining for 
ASML employees is restricted. We strive to comply with 
the relevant legislations in every country where we 
operate. In those countries where we have employee 
representation, we engage in regular dialogue with the 
different organizations representing our employees. In 
these conversations, topics are put forward and 
discussed by both the company and the employee 
representatives. The working conditions and terms of 
employment of employees not directly covered by 
collective bargaining agreements are influenced or 
determined based on other collective bargaining 
agreements, labor market developments and usage and 
habits in the specific country.
When it comes to remuneration, our approach is to be 
fair and balanced. In our Remuneration Policy, we are 
committed to gender equality and we strive for global 
consistency while respecting what is common practice in 
local markets. We continuously review how our 
remuneration compares with the market benchmark for 
technology professionals in each region where we 
operate and, where necessary, make changes to our 
remuneration policies and levels.Remote working
Following the pandemic, we recognize that patterns of 
work have changed, and we want to continue to have a 
positive impact on the well-being, productivity and work 
– life balance of our people. We aim to provide ASML 
employees and their managers with clear guidance and 
help them to make the right choices between working 
remotely and working in the office. Remote working is 
neither mandatory nor an entitlement. As a global 
guideline, employees may work remotely up to two 
working days per week if the job allows. There may be 
exceptions for certain jobs or departments.
Fundamentally, ASML is convinced that employees 
themselves can best manage their own work. At the

resources and initiatives in place for teams and managers to 
get the right conversations going.
Our offerings include general support for employees, 
training and masterclasses, well-being events, and 
physical and mental health checks. In Veldhoven we 
have a dedicated health & well-being center that provides 
several health & well-being employee services including 
an in-house physiotherapist, psychologist, career center, 
indoor gym, yoga room and a running track. We currently 
have more than 165 well-being ambassadors globally,

Our approach
Public–private partnership
We cooperate with private partners in research and 
innovation projects subsidized by the European Union 
and its member states. We run collaborative subsidy 
projects aimed at advancing integrated circuit (IC) 
technology for the next node connected to the industry 
roadmap following Moore’s Law. The Horizon Europe 
program, a public–private partnership, facilitates 
collaboration and strengthens the impact of research and 
innovation in developing, supporting and implementing 
EU policies while tackling global challenges.
By collaborating in European projects, ASML and its 
partners play a role in giving the continent a degree of 
sovereignty by driving and accelerating fundamental 
research and ground-breaking innovation in EMEA. This 
collaboration also generates significant business value, 
fuels job creation and creates knowledge. The increasing 
number of patent requests per year, both for ASML and 
the other members in the various consortia, 
demonstrates the success of these collaborations.
Partnerships with academia and research institutes
We co-develop expertise within a wide network of 
technology partners, such as universities and research 
institutions. Our partners include imec in Belgium, the 
technical universities in Twente, Delft and Eindhoven in 
the Netherlands and the Advanced Research Center for 
Nanolithography (ARCNL), also in the Netherlands. 
ARCNL conducts fundamental research and focusing on 
the physics and chemistry that are important in current 
and future key technologies within nanolithography and 
its application within the semiconductor industry.Our targets for research and development
Our R&D partnerships are underpinned by a number of 
targets:
– Reach >€4bn R&D investments by 2025
– Grow R&D spend over 100% from 2019 base year
Our performance in 2022
Our R&D investments in 2022 amounted to €3.3 billion, 
which represents 63% growth from the 2019 investment 
level.
Our own contribution in R&D across public–private 
partnerships in 2022 was €14.7 million, and the total 
value of our investment for the full three-year duration of 
our projects is €88.9 million, with a total project size of 
€438.9 million. Across all of our projects, we work with 
universities, research and technology institutes and other 
high-tech companies across EMEA – varying from 20 to 
80 partners from 12 different European countries – to 
help enable the industry to move toward next-generation 
technology.Our actions in 2022
Public–private partnerships
In 2022, we continued coordinating efforts in four EU 
projects – TAPES3, PIN3S, IT2 and  ID2PPAC – all with a 
duration of three years. We have enabled timely reporting 
to the connected public partners, and have organized 
online consortium meetings to exchange ideas and 
knowledge. The TAPES3 project was successfully closed 
in April 2022, when an online project review meeting 
involving independent experts from the industry hired by 
the European Commission evaluated the results of the 
project.
In 2022, we submitted a project proposal – 14ACMOS – 
in the first call of the newly established Key Digital 
Technologies Joint Undertaking. The aim of this three-
year project is to explore and realize solutions for the 
manufacture of 14 angstrom (1.4 nm) CMOS chip 
technology. A consortium has been formed that covers 
four key areas needed in IC technology development for 
manufacture – lithography, metrology, mask 
infrastructure and process technology.
The 14ACMOS project brings together the R&D 
capabilities of 25 leading expert partners to tackle these 
challenges. It is valued at more than €95 million in R&D 
costs and unlocks at least €27 million in public funding 
for the ecosystem. In terms of geography, the project 
connects people from Romania, the United Kingdom, 
Belgium, Sweden, France, Germany, Israel and the 
Netherlands.

Our approach
To nurture innovation by new generations of 
technological talents, we also provide valuable expertise 
to support entrepreneurs and startups. We make use of 
our experts’ in-depth competencies and knowledge to 
develop and support startups and scaleups. By fostering 
entrepreneurship, we aim to help these young 
enterprises excel and grow. What we share is based on 
what we are good at, such as building complex 
manufacturing systems. This is where we can play a role 
and make a difference.
Sharing our expertise strengthens our regional high-tech 
ecosystem, particularly around our headquarters in 
Veldhoven, the Netherlands. This region has a 
competitive edge globally, and we need to make sure we 
maintain this position. Building a strong regional 
foundation offers benefits not just to ASML and 
associated partners, but also to other companies and 
organizations. In addition, it helps attract a broad base of 
talent to the region.
Through HighTechXL and DeepTechXL, we build, finance 
and accelerate impactful startups by combining high-
tech entrepreneurial talent and relevant technologies. 
With the Make Next Platform, we aim to support young, 
innovative high-tech scaleups. And through 
DeepTechXL, we help to finance these deep-tech 
ventures, particularly in the early stages where risks are 
still at their highest.Make Next Platform
To support young innovative high-tech scaleups, ASML 
founded the Make Next Platform (MNP) in 2016 together 
with Huisman, Vanderlande and the non-profit Stichting 
Technology Rating (STR). Thales NL joined as a co-
founder in 2019. MNP puts the partners’ network, 
competencies, expertise and experience to work in 
answering questions that these scaleups encounter in 
their development and helps them grow into sustainable 
companies.
MNP aims to help emerging high-tech ventures that have 
moved beyond the startup phase and are ready to 
expand. These scaleup companies face challenges such

Supporting startups and scaleups
 
Our performance in 2022
In 2022, ASML committed to providing more than €15 
million support to high-tech startups and scaleups, with 
4,180 hours of in-kind support provided and over €14 
million cash committed. This commitment includes our 
contribution to the DeepTechXL startup investment fund 
for early-phase funding. 12% of startups reached Star 
level.
To date, the MNP has screened more than 250 
companies and engaged with the management teams of 
more than 60 of them. So far, 10 scaleups have been 
adopted, including three in 2022. Meanwhile, one has 
reached Alumnus status and is now finding their own 
way, based on their own strengths: SMART Photonics 
(2021).
Our actions in 2022
ASML as a venture builder
In 2022, we became a strategic investor and co-initiator 
in DeepTechXL Fund I, a new Dutch deep-tech fund of 
€85 million. Together with the other investing industry 
partners (Philips, Brabantse Ontwikkelings Maatschappij 
(BOM), research institute TNO, PME Pension Fund, 
Invest-NL and some family offices), the fund provides 
deep-tech startups and scaleups with access to 
knowledge, network, technology, licenses and business 
development support, and it intends to finance these 
tech ventures particularly in their early stage of growth, 
where investments risks are still at the highest. The fund 
aims to introduce launching customers, find partners in

The standard weekly working hours in the locations

company standards are based on the International Labor 
Standards of the International Labor Organization (the 
Forty-Hour Week Convention) and the RBA norms. A 
working week must not exceed the maximum set by

including overtime, except in an emergency or unusual

Social - Our supply chain.Information security
With ASML’s unique position and the growing 
geopolitical tensions in the semiconductor industry, we 
see increasing security risk trends, ranging from 
ransomware and phishing attacks to attempts to acquire 
intellectual property or disrupt business continuity.  
In 2022, ASML registered around 2,800 cybersecurity 
incidents, excluding phishing. We don’t believe that any 
of these incidents has had a material impact on our 
business. See “Risk Factors – Cybersecurity and other 
security incidents, or other disruptions in our processes 
or information technology systems, could materially 
adversely affect our business operations”. We have 
increased the number of FTEs from 10 around a decade 
ago to around 300 FTEs dedicated to security matters in 
2022. 
Security – like safety and quality – is a prerequisite for 
trust in the ASML brand. Our customers and partners

ASML is committed to helping build a fairer and more sustainable society through social economic 
cohesion, sustainable growth and long-term prosperity. Taxation is a means to that end.
 
The following principles guide us in how we report and 
pay tax in the countries we operate in.
The Board of Management is accountable for ASML’s 
tax strategy, tax principles and the overall tax risk 
management, which are subsequently reviewed by the 
Audit Committee. The ASML Tax & Customs department

social responsibility aspects relevant to 
ASML. In fulfilling its management tasks 
and responsibilities, the Board of 
Management is guided by the interests of 
ASML and its business and takes into 
consideration the interests of our 
stakeholders.  The current Board of Management comprises five 
members. On October 19, 2022, the Supervisory Board 
announced its intention to expand the Board of 
Management to six members effective per the 2023 
AGM, adding the Chief Strategic Sourcing & 
Procurement function as a Board of Management 
position, given the increased strategic importance of this 
function for ASML’s strategy.
The Board of Management has a dual leadership 
structure, under the chairmanship of the President and 
Chief Executive Officer, and the vice chairmanship of the 
President and Chief Technology Officer. The Board of 
Management divides tasks among its members, charging 
individual members with specific managerial tasks. 
However, the Board of Management remains collectively

social responsibility issues important for ASML.Important management decisions, such as setting the 
operational and financial objectives, the strategy 
designed to achieve these objectives, major investments, 
budget and the issue, repurchase and cancellation of 
shares, require the Supervisory Board’s approval. 
The Supervisory Board is governed by its Rules of 
Procedure. Items covered in these rules include the 
responsibilities of the Supervisory Board and its 
committees, the composition of the Supervisory Board 
and its committees, logistics surrounding the meetings, 
the meeting attendance of members of the Supervisory 
Board, the rotation schedule for these members and the 
committee charters. The Supervisory Board’s Rules of 
Procedure and the committee charters are regularly 
reviewed and, if needed, amended. The Audit Committee 
charter is reviewed annually to confirm that the charter 
still complies with applicable rules and regulations, 
especially those relating to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

the gender balance targets to the Dutch Social and

of the Dutch gender diversity bill, as both men and 
women are represented on the Supervisory Board by at 
least three out of nine members.
Currently , no seats are taken by women on the Board of 
Management. During 2022, the Supervisory Board set a 
gender balance target for the Board of Management to in 
2026 have at least one female and a at least one male 
Board of Management member. Taking into account the 
intended appointment of Wayne Allan as member of the 
Board of Management per the 2023 AGM, this would 
lead to a female representation of at least 17% based on 
the size of the Board of Management per the 2023 AGM, 
being six members. When setting the gender balance

How we respond
Since the pandemic, employee expectations have 
continued to change, especially around work-life 
balance, hybrid working and well-being. Staying on top 
of these trends and understanding how the world of 
work and expectations is evolving is a key part of our 
strategy to attract and retain talent.
Inclusion, well-being and job enablement are the key 
themes we will focus on to further increase our 
engagement. Cross-collaboration and sharing 
knowledge across teams also remain subjects for 
improvement.  
We engage with our suppliers to help deliver our innovations. 
They are critical to our value chain and our ambition to be a sustainable 
leader in the semiconductor industry.

Our key priorities for 2024 are the attraction and 
retention of skilled talent to support our business growth . 
We intend to do this by continuing to monitor and drive a 
strong employer brand reputation.  
We will continue to support and enable a (potentially) 
best-in-class employee experience through focused 
programs and communications around learning and 
development, our commitment to well-being, diversity 
and inclusion, and strong leadership. In doing this, we 
aim to truly drive an employer brand experience from the 
inside out.
We will run both global campaigns and events and drive 
segmented outreach in each of our key locations. In this 
way, we hope to showcase ASML and let potential 
employees see, feel and experience what it’s like to work 
for us. We will also focus on key areas such as talent 
engagement with top-tier universities, candidate and 
employee experience, and talent attraction to key roles. 
To support and measure the effectiveness of our efforts 
we will carry out talent surveys in each key location either 
every 12 or every 18 months to monitor our progress in 
each of the countries.
Lastly, we will continue to monitor and listen to (potential) 
employees in an effort to continuously improve their

Working practices and remuneration 
ASML is committed to providing fair labor conditions


===== reports | ASML | 2023 ASML Annual Report =====

and social protection for all its employees, regardless 
of their location and whether they are on fixed or 
temporary contracts. We support the principles of the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) and respect the 
rights of all employees to form and join trade unions of 
their own choosing, to bargain collectively and to 
engage in peaceful assembly.
Freedom of association  
We have no indication that we operate in countries 
where the freedom of association and collective 
bargaining for ASML employees is restricted. We strive 
to comply with the relevant legislation in every country 
where we operate. 
In those countries where we have employee 
representation, we engage in regular dialogue with the 
different organizations representing our employees. 
Topics are put forward and discussed by both the 
company and the employee representatives. The 
working conditions and terms of employment of 
employees not directly covered by collective bargaining 
agreements are influenced or determined based on 
other collective bargaining agreements, labor market 
developments and usage and habits in the specific 
country.Fair remuneration
Our approach to remuneration is to be fair and 
balanced. In our Remuneration Policy, we are 
committed to gender equality and we strive for global 
consistency while respecting common practice in local 
markets. We continuously review how our 
remuneration compares with the market benchmark for 
technology professionals in each region where we 
operate and, where necessary, make changes to our 
remuneration policies and levels.
ASML is committed to meeting adequate living-wage 
requirements. This means that employees earn salaries 
that meet their and their families’ basic needs to 
maintain an adequate standard of life in the 
circumstances of each country where we operate, and 
we also provide some discretionary income. Our 
company has a predominantly highly educated 
workforce with relatively high levels of remuneration 
and, on average, our salaries are significantly above the 
local living wage.
In 2022, as part of a two-year cycle, we conducted an 
analysis of how our lowest base salary compared with 
the local minimum wage and local ‘living wage’ in the 
countries and regions where we operate. We did not 
detect any gaps. We also analyze paid salaries for 
gender disparity annually. In 2023, as in previous 
years, we found no major differences in these salaries. 
However, we would like to further investigate this 
domain in the future, to ensure that we do not have

===== reports | ASML | 2023 ASML Annual Report =====

resources – mental, physical, social and financial well-
being. We provide specific resources and initiatives for 
teams and managers to get the right conversations going 
and guide their well-being journeys.  
Our offerings include general support for employees and 
leaders, training courses and masterclasses, well-being 
events, and physical and mental health checks. At our 
head office in Veldhoven, a dedicated health and well-
being center provides several employee services 
including an in-house physiotherapist and psychologist, 
career center, indoor gym, yoga room and a running 
track. 
The biggest challenge we face is in encouraging people 
to get into the habit of prioritizing their well-being as part 
of their day-to-day work, and to help them find and use 
the available support in their well-being journeys. We 
have close to 300 well-being ambassadors helping us to 
spread well-being across our global organization, and the 
network continues to expand.
Well-being is measured primarily  through the well-being 
score in our we@ASML engagement survey. Our t arget 
was to improve from 77% in 2022 to 78% in 2023.2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Well-being 74% 77% 69% 77%  81% 
From the 2023 survey, our well-being score improved 
from 77% in 2022 to 81% in 2023 , which is above our 
targeted score.  
Through a deep dive into the actual survey results, we 
have id entified those groups of employees where well-
being scores need to be improved , and we will define 
tailored interventions to execute on this in close 
cooperation with managers and HR business partners.
For 2024, we aim to maintain an overall well-being score 
of 81%, and no scores on individual questions within the

Our actions in 2023
We saw significant progress within the Learning 
eXperience Platform (LXP) in 2023, with content curation 
and the creation of learning journeys helping our 
employees to easily find the learning they need, when 
they need it. We also embedded well-being principles in 
learning program delivery.
We stepped up our use of data and metrics to improve 
how we strategize our well-being programming and 
updated the well-being section of the we@ASML survey. 
We carried out additional research into well-being needs, 
both in general and within diversity groups through our 
employee networks.
We held the first Global Health & Well-being Week in 
June and launched an enriched self-facilitation tool for 
teams to work on well-being in 20 23. A development 
program that consisted of several workshops and 
interactive sessions was exclusively offered to our 
network of well-being ambassadors, which grew from 
200 to 300 members. 
In July, we launched an employee assistance program 
(EAP) for Europe. As was already the case through EAPs 
in Asia and the US, ASML employees and their families in 
the EU can now also get 24/7 support, counseling and 
help with anything that negatively impacts their mental 
health, work-life balance and/or productivity at work. Looking ahead
Our plans for 2024 are to:
•Create an ASML-wide learning and knowledge 
management onboarding and off-boarding experience, 
aligned across the ASML Academy .

How we’re managing 
our impact
To enable the semiconductor industry to move toward 
next-generation technology, we collaborate with 
universities, research and technology institutes and other 
high-tech companies with a total of 7 0 different partners 
spanning 12 European countries .
Public–private partnerships 
We work closely with private partners to develop and 
deliver research and innovation projects that are 
subsidized by the EU and its member states. 
Collaborative subsidy projects are aimed at advancing 
integrated circuit (IC) technology for the semiconductor 
industry while following Moore's Law, with a continuous

Partnerships for research and development
Developing the next generation of lithography technology
Our longstanding and extensive technical collaboration with imec 
aims to identify and mitigate challenges in introducing High NA 
EUV for our customers. These include choices of resist and their 
stochastic (randomly variable) effects, reticle absorber materials 
and the necessary metrology and inspection tools to examine the 
quality of the printed features on a chip. 
As an indication of the impact of our collaboration, more than 
30% of the oral paper presentations we submitted to the 2023 
international society for optics and photonics (SPIE) Advanced 
Lithography and Patterning conference (SPIE ALP 2023) were 
derived from our collaboration with imec.

Our actions in 2023
Public-private partnerships 
In 2023, we continued coordinating efforts in four EU 
projects – Pilot Integration of 3nm Semiconductor 
technology (PIN3S), IC Technology for the 2nm Node 
(IT2), Integration of processes and modules for the 2nm 
node meeting Power Performance Area and Cost 
requirements (ID2PPAC), and 14 Anstrom CMOS IC 
technology (14ACMOS) – all with a duration of three 
years. We have enabled timely reporting to the 
connected public partners and have organized face-to-
face and online consortium meetings to exchange ideas 
and knowledge. The PIN3S project was successfully 
closed in July 2023, during a face-to-face final project 
review meeting. This took place at the premises of NOVA 
Israel, one of the beneficiaries of the project, and involved 
independent experts from the industry hired by the 
European Commission, who evaluated the results of the 
project. There also have been observers representing the 
German and Belgian national authorities. 
During the year we also commenced a new project – 
14AMI. This project was submitted at the second call of 
Key Digital Technologies Joint Undertaking (KDT JU). 
This three-year project focuses on module integration for 
the manufacture of 14 angstrom (1.4 nm) CMOS chips. A 
consortium has been formed that covers four key areas 
needed in IC technology development for manufacture – 
lithography, metrology, mask infrastructure and process 
technology.The 14AMI project brings together the R&D capabilities 
of 31 leading expert partners to tackle these challenges. 
It is valued at more than €108 million in R&D costs and 
unlocks at least €47 million in public funding for the 
ecosystem. In terms of geography, the project connects 
people from Romania, Belgium, France, Germany, 
Austria, Israel, Switzerland and the Netherlands. 
In addition, ASML participates in the KDT JU project 
SC4EU, led by Infineon Technologies AG in Germany. 
This project was submitted in response to the special 
topic call of KDT JU in 2023 on improving the global 
demand supply forecast of the semiconductor supply 
chain. The project connects various semiconductor 
players across Europe and involves partners from 
Germany, Greece, France, Austria and the Netherlands.Looking ahead
Investing in future talent
Universities, industries and governments must 
collaborate more closely in Europe to invest in a 
collaborative knowledge network to drive innovation, and 
ASML is investing heavily in broad academic 
collaboration with major universities in Europe. For 
example, our collaboration with Eindhoven University of 
Technology (TU/e) is scaling up our already proven, 
longstanding relationship by bringing together the best in 
science and engineering talent in the Brainport 
Eindhoven region.
In April 2023, TU/e and ASML signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding to jointly develop a 10-year strategic 
research roadmap in the fields of plasma physics, AI, 
mechatronics and semiconductor lithography. TU/e and 
ASML will invest substantially and equally in the joint 
program, which will create up to 40 PhD positions every 
year, for which TU/e will recruit internationally renowned 
top scientific talents. We will supply our top engineers as 
hybrid teachers and will increase the number of 
internships we host. TU/e and ASML are in discussion  to create a new ASML 
research facility on the TU/e campus, where we intend to 
co-locate the many competences of our research team. 
The facility will have shared workspaces, meeting rooms, 
research labs and a state-of-the-art cleanroom facility. 
An open-access research laboratory will make analytical 
and production equipment available to TU/e and other 
research centers and industrial partners. This 
collaborative space will enable growth and synergy 
across academic research fields of mutual interest, such 
as photonics, quantum computing, nanomaterials and

How we’re managing 
our impact
We support startups and scaleups with the ambition to 
contribute to a better, more sustainable world  by 
addressing the UN’s S DGs, by providing both monetary 
and non-monetary contributions . We participate in 
startup and scaleup support platforms – such as 
HighTechXL and Make Next Platform – to build and 
accelerate impactful startups by combining high-tech 
entrepreneurial talent and relevant technologies. Via 
these platforms, we use our unique knowledge and 
expertise to address the business and technical 
questions of existing startups and scaleups.  
We also match our experienced employees with startups 
and scaleups. This increases our impact and benefits the 
personal development of employees by enabling them to

Supporting startups and scaleups
Our actions in 2023
To date,  over 20 new d eep-tech ventures have 
completed our startup and scaleup support program  and 
some are already receiving global attention. Moreover, 
several new ventures are currently still in the accelerator 
program, making good progress, and new cohorts are 
already planned. An example is VSParticle – read more in 
box out on the right . 
ASML hosted a Suppliers' Day workshop in 2023, where 
scaleups presented their most concerning issues 
together with their most relevant supplier. ASML and 
other MNP founders provided expertise and insights, 
while other scaleups contributed their relevant 
experiences, allowing companies to learn not only from 
the experts, but also from each other. Such workshops 
are highly appreciated by scaleups supported by MNP.
Looking ahead
Next to continuing our current efforts in 2024, our focus 
will also be on identifying additional venture capital 
partners to further strengthen our regional startup 
innovation ecosystem. We will also develop a strategy for 
rolling out our efforts to other regions where ASML has a 
presence that can be used to provide regional in-kind 
support. These additional efforts, which are the result of 
our growing ambition to create an impact, will generate a 
need to adjust our KPIs accordingly. In 2024, we will 
work to define more appropriate KPIs aligned with our 
augmented objectives.VSParticle – Accelerating innovations to market through dry deposition of pure nanomaterials
VSParticle (VSP) was founded in 2014 as a spin-off 
from Delft University of Technology, with the mission to 
unlock an unprecedented amount of new high-tech 
materials. Why? Because today's society is transitioning 
from a fossil fuel base to a mineral-intensive one. All 
sustainable technologies such as solar, wind and 
electrical vehicles, which are needed to keep global 
warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, are creating a 
demand for new materials that society has never seen 
before. The staggering amount of material innovation 
required in the next 10 years is equal to what the best 
material scientist could normally do in one hundred 
years.

Neurodiversity is one of the drivers of increasing diversity 
in Brainport classrooms. Schools are not always able to 
recognize the needs of neurodiverse students in order to 
provide the required support. This leads to greater 
demands on special education, underperformance, and 
children at home. We have approved and started up a 
significant project, which will be up and running in 2024, 
to support the educational system in providing adequate 
support for neurodiverse students in regular schools. The 
aim is to show the increase in demand for special 
education, support children to reach their potential and 
reduce the number of children who no longer attend 
schoo l.
Students with a different  native language
Schools  in the Brainport Eindhoven region have 
challenges absorbing the inflow of international children, 
leading to a sharp increase in the number of children with 
an international background flowing into special 
education. Since 50% of the international students are 
children from knowledge migrants, we take our 
responsibility by strengthening the Brainport Eindhoven 
educational sector region to absorb the growing number 
of international students, and thereby re duce the 
additional inflow into special education .
Students from  disad vanta ged backgrounds
Students from disadvantaged backgrounds do not have 
the same opportunities in education as their peers. This 
results in underperformance in education, which is also 
reflected in their subsequent career. This program aims 
to provide students from disadvantaged backgrounds 
with equal opportunities to allow them to thrive in their

ASML works in many different countries where we have 
extremely complex supply chains and where laws relating 
to the protection of human rights can vary. Our biggest 
challenge is to ensure that the beneficiaries of the 
changes we make are those people most at risk of 
potential violations.
Like many companies, we are faced with the challenge of 
understanding how to implement the plethora  of 
regulations and international instruments – including ESG 
legislation – covering the topic of human rights, in a way 
that makes efficient use of resources, engages the right 
stakeholders and achieve s outcomes for workers and 
others who could be impacted by our activities .
Against a landscape of interconnected global and 
geopolitical challenges and increasing uncertainty due to 
the war in Ukraine and, most recen tly, the conflict in the 
Middle East, challenges we face in relation to human 
rights will only become more critical and more central to 
business decisions. We are facing evolving societal 
expectations and want to find ways we can make a real 
impact, but ASML cannot do this alone and therefore we 
are connecting with peers to understand how best to 
tackle any future human rights - related  issues that may

We believe that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric for our investors, reflecting cash that is available for acquisitions, to repay debt and to return money to our shareholders by 
means of dividends and share buybacks. Purchase of property, plant and equipment and purchase of intangible assets are deducted from net cash provided by operating activities in

important for ASML.Important management decisions – such as setting the 
operational and financial objectives, the strategy 
designed to achieve these objectives, major 
investments, budget, and the issue, repurchase and

approval.
The Supervisory Board is governed by its Rules of 
Procedure. Items covered in these rules include the 
responsibilities of the Supervisory Board and its 
committees, the composition of the Supervisory Board 
and its committees, logistics surrounding the meetings, 
the meeting attendance of members of the Supervisory 
Board, the rotation schedule for these members and the 
committee charters. The Supervisory Board’s Rules of 
Procedure and the committee charters are regularly 
reviewed and, if needed, amended. The Audit 
Committee charter is reviewed annually to confirm that it 
still complies with applicable rules and regulations, 
including those relating to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

1.Dutch pension arrangements have a threshold in the build-up of pension entitlements. This threshold exists because all participants are 
assumed to be entitled to the Dutch state pension (AOW) and therefore do not need an additional pension over the first part of their 
pensionable income. The minimum level in the fiscal legislation for this threshold is related to the AOW allowance and is known as the 
Witteveen threshold. This threshold is calculated as the annual AOW allowance (including holiday allowance) for a married person times 10/7.

Circular economy: Systems
Our refurbishment program is mainly 
involved in industrializing refurbishments 
with existing hardware. This means making 
sure the consumables, parts that show wear, 
and any upgrades that we may need to do 
have procedures and sequences available to 
ensure low cycle time and cost.
Redesigning parts to avoid obsolescence
We track spare parts in our portfolio to see 
how they are being used and identify when 
we expect to run out of individual items – 
and, for PAS and (N)XT systems, we use this 
information to update our priorities for 
redesign. We have identified and plan to 
execute more than 100 redesign projects for 
nearly 300 parts in the coming years – 
particularly relevant for electronic parts, for 
which the evolution of technology has been 
faster than in any other field. We will 
continue to increase our focus on local 
repair to extend the life of the mature 
installed base at lower cost, reducing the 
need to redesign and buy new materials and 
parts.Resources

Reuse of packaging and transport tools
Valuable transportation materials – such as 
packaging, locking and plug materials – are 
used to safely transport our modules and

once they reach their destination, these 
transportation materials are reused. 
We are improving the reuse of packaging, 
lockings and plugs from the field and

KPIs, analytics and infrastructure to secure 
reuse over new purchase.
In 2024, we continued to make progress in 
reusing thousands of small auxiliary 
materials, such as plugs, flanges, caps and 
brackets. These are now being reused for 
system parts in our factories or for shipping 
machines to our customers.

EU Taxonomy disclosure
The EU Taxonomy alignment assessment considers 
whether the economic activity:
•Is Taxonomy-eligible (i.e. if the economic activity is 
included in the EU Taxonomy list of eligible activities)
•Makes a substantial contribution to at least one of the 
environmental objectives
•Does not significantly harm (DNSH) any of the other 
objectives
•Meets minimum safeguards constituted chiefly by the 
OECD Guidelines and UN Guiding Principles 
The substantial contribution and DNSH criteria are 
collectively referred to as the ‘technical screening 
criteria’.
Reporting scope
The EU Taxonomy has been prepared on a consolidated 
basis, the scope of which is the same as for the 
Consolidated financial statements in line with the EU-
IFRS. No subsidiaries are exempt. Basis for preparation
We prepared our EU Taxonomy disclosure in 
accordance with Commission Delegated Regulations EU

The EU Taxonomy at ASML (continued)

Operational expenditure
The EU Taxonomy defines the denominator of the opex 
KPI as any direct non-capitalized costs that relate to 
R&D, building renovation, short-term lease, maintenance 
and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to 
the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and 
equipment by the undertaking party, or third party to 
whom activities are outsourced, that are necessary to 
ensure the continued and effective functioning of such 
assets. 
Under this definition, the total opex for ASML is limited 
to R&D costs in the Consolidated financial statements 
which is eligible under CE 1.2. The proportion of total 
opex that relates to Taxonomy-eligible and aligned 
activities is determined by assessing opex related to 
assets or processes associated with Taxonomy-eligible 
and aligned activities, such as training, other human 
resources adaptation needs, and direct non-capitalized 
costs that represent R&D.
The EU Taxonomy 
requires companies 
to report to what 
extent their economic 
activities are 
Taxonomy-eligible 
and aligned. Operational expenditure
<Not eligible 0%
<Eligible – Not aligned (A.2) 100%
<Eligible – Aligned (A.1) 0%Minimum safeguards
Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy also outlines the 
minimum safeguards (MS) criteria that must be met for 
an economic activity to be considered Taxonomy-
aligned. These safeguards essentially act as a ‘safety 
net’ to ensure that while an activity contributes to an 
environmental objective, it does not, for example, breach 
human rights law – the minimum safeguards essentially 
work to mandate a just transition.
The MS can also be categorized into four topics: human 
rights (including labor and consumer rights), anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption, taxation and fair competition. After 
the update of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises in 2023 we further improved our processes 
to identify, cease, prevent, mitigate and remediate 
human rights impacts in our value chains to align our 
operations and practices with the update. 
For more detailed information, we refer to the ASML 
Code of Conduct, the ASML Human Rights Policy or the 
RBA Code of Conduct for ASML’s current practices 
related to human rights in our own operation and value 
chains. Nuclear and fossil gas related activities

The EU Taxonomy at ASML (continued)

For all our eligible circular economy activities, we 
assessed the technical screening criteria to determine 
the conditions under which the activities qualified 
as substantially contributing to the transition to a circular 
economy, and whether those activities 
caused no significant harm to any of the other 
environmental objectives. The Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment 
(CE 1.2) and the other activities related to turnover 
(Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing (CE 5.1), 
Sale of spare parts (CE 5.2) and Sale of second-hand 
goods (CE 5.4)) did not meet the technical screening 
criteria. Specifically, the criteria under 2.4 Design for 
dismantling, 2.5 Design for recyclability, 2.6 Proactive substitution of hazardous substances and 2.7 
Information to customers are not fully met. 
For this reason, we are reporting 0% of aligned activities 
for these economic activities. Since the reporting of 
alignment for the Environmental Delegated Act outlining 
the circular economy activities is only applicable as of the reporting period 2024, no comparative alignment figures 
are included in the table below. 
Currently, we have no objectives or plans (capex plans 
as referred to by the Disclosures Delegated Act) for 
aligning our economic activities under turnover with the 
criteria established in the near future.

Capital expenditure (continued)
The table on the left indicates the extent of eligibility and alignment per environmental objective, including activities contributing 
substantially to several objectives.
For all our eligible operational expenditure (opex) 
activities, we assessed the technical screening criteria.
The proportion of total opex that relates to Taxonomy-
aligned activities is determined by assessing opex 
related to assets or processes associated with 
Taxonomy-aligned economic activities, including training and other human resources adaptation needs, and 
direct non-capitalized costs that represent R&D. We 
assessed the economic activities of the R&D costs that 
are not capitalized but accounted for in our 
Consolidated statement of profit or loss associated with 
CE 1.2 Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment. Since the technical screening criteria for our 
activities under circular economy are not met, we report 
0% alignment related to assets and processes that are 
associated with the economic activities under circular 
economy. Since the reporting of alignment for the Environmental 
Delegated Act outlining the circular economy activities is

social protection for all our workers, 
regardless of their location and whether 
they are on fixed or temporary contracts. 
This includes, in accordance with local 
laws, respecting the rights of all workers to 
form and join trade unions of their own 
choosing, to bargain collectively and to 
engage in peaceful assembly – as well as 
the right for workers to refrain from such 
activities. 
We are committed to paying fair and 
balanced salaries and benefits. Employee 
wages must, at a minimum, comply with all 
applicable wage laws, including those 
relating to living wages, equal wages for all 
genders, overtime hours and legally 
mandated benefits. 
We believe we have robust, longstanding 
compensation policies in place which aim 
to ensure people performing and working in 
similar jobs are paid similarly. This is 
reflected in how our pay structures are 
designed, taking account of pay 
progression to align with our employees’ 
growth within roles as well as progression 
to new roles. We are transparent with our 
employees around our compensation 
policies and practices and have continued 
to strengthen our Compensation & Benefits 
team with the aim to ensure our policies 
and processes are fairly and universally 
applied.  We periodically review how our remuneration 
compares with the market benchmark for 
technology professionals in the regions we 
operate in and, where necessary, make 
changes to remuneration policies and levels.
Meeting adequate living-wage requirements 
means ensuring employees earn salaries 
that meet their and their families’ basic 
needs to maintain an adequate standard of 
living in the circumstances of each country 
where we operate. We compare our lowest 
base salary with the local minimum wage 
and local living wage in the countries and 
regions where we operate.
Work weeks are not to exceed the maximum 
set by local laws. In the event that local laws 
do not stipulate a maximum, we apply the 
International Labor Standards of the ILO and 
the RBA norms, including those applicable 
to overtime hours. Unless local laws 
stipulate otherwise, workweeks should not 
be more than 60 hours per week including 
overtime, except in an emergency or unusual 
situation. The standard weekly working 
hours in the locations where we operate is 
on average 40 hours. We strive to respect 
the right to rest and leisure, including 
reasonable working hours.
We monitor the effectiveness of our policies 
and actions regarding labor conditions by 
tracking employee engagement, compliance 
with local laws and a set of performance 
indicators. Some performance indicators 
include: the number and percentage of 
employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and worker representation, the 
percentage of employees paid an adequate 
wage, incidents reported via our Speak Up 
Service and occupational health and safety 
incidents reported via myEHS.
Well-being
We support our employees in achieving a 
balance between family and work at 
different stages of their life. We look at 
well-being holistically and strive to integrate 
it into everyone’s day-to-day work.
We have identified four well-being 
dimensions around which our programs, 
tools and resources are provided: mental;


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

physical; social; and financial. Our well-
being framework brings together all of our 
well-being activities to drive initiatives 
region by region and to meet local needs. 
Well-being offerings include general 
support, training and masterclasses, well-
being events, and physical and mental 
health checks for employees and in some 
cases non-employee workers. We have an 
employee assistance program in all 
countries, offering support for employees 
who need assistance with personal and/or 
work-related problems that may impact 
their job or mental or emotional well-being.
We set a target to measure the 
effectiveness of our approach through the 
employee engagement survey well-being 
score.Our well-established EHS management 
system enables our managers and 
employees to effectively integrate EHS 
objectives, plans, processes, standards 
and behaviors into their daily work –

Social – Attractive workplace for all  – Talent 
attraction, employee engagement and retention
In addition to the direct channels available, 
we also engage in regular dialogue with 
workers' representatives, including duly 
elected representatives and trade union 
representatives. Duly elected workers' representatives 
Works Councils have been established in 
the Netherlands and in Berlin, Germany. 
In Taiwan and South Korea, employee 
representatives have been duly elected in 
accordance with Labor Management Council 
requirements, and in China we have retained 
pre-existing Works Councils at our HMI 
facility. These councils consist of elected 
employee representatives from across 
the organization. The number of council 
members and the specific election 
procedures are determined by the location 
and size of the organization.
Works Councils balance the interests of 
employees with those of the business and 
are often required to consent or advise on 
specific decisions, such as reorganizations, 
mergers or changes in employment 
conditions (although this may vary in 
different locations). To better understand the 
needs and concerns of the organization, the 
Supervisory Board (SB) regularly meets with 
our largest Works Council in the 
Netherlands, which provides a clear 
communications channel for the feelings of 
our people. In countries where we do not 
have formal employee representation, we 
promote open dialogue through our various 
employee channels and networks.Veldhoven, Netherlands 
The Works Council meets regularly with 
the BoM and senior management, and 
meets annually with the delegation of the 
SB. Every month there is a consultative 
meeting between the Works Council and the

Acting on employee feedback
Employee engagement is an ongoing program with no 
specific time horizon. It is one of continuous 
improvement – with annual initiatives and actions 
addressing specific areas identified in the most recent 
employee engagement survey results.In 2023, we identified that trust in the follow-up to the 
survey was low. The main areas for improvement 
identified were well-being, inclusion and job enablement, 
which informed the actions taken by the end of 2024. 
These included:

How we're managingOur actions and resources
Simplifying the learning journey   
Our learning program is one of continuous 
improvement. With our growth, we 
accordingly need to build on our employees’ 
competence. With this in mind, our focus is 
on reducing the time-to-knowledge – that 
is, how long it takes an employee to acquire 
the relevant knowledge – and time-to-
competence, which relates to the time taken 
to reach true competence in an acquired 
skill. 
To achieve this, in 2024 we introduced role-
based learning journeys. 
A learning journey comprises a curated 
collection of educational content, both 
formal and informal, that is available to 
employees to be used to acquire skills for a 
specific role or assist in the setting of a 
development plan as part of our Develop & 
Perform program.We have identified 24 key roles, for which 
we have built learning journeys with the 
purpose of helping our employees to map 
their development and to shift more easily 
into other roles and to onboard new 
employees into their roles at an effective 
pace. In the current year, a total of 
1,771,544  hours of learning were recorded, 
with an average of 41 learning hours 
completed per employee. Role-based 
learning journeys help employees identify 
which learnings are most relevant and 
represent the best use of their time.
Depending on the feedback of our 
employees, we will improve on the 24 
journeys which will further serve as the 
foundation for the building of more role-
based journeys in the future.
Empowering employees on their 
development journey
Our Develop & Perform program was 
initiated in 2022 and we continue to gather 
input and feedback for continuous 
improvements. 
In 2024, we focused on encouraging 
employees to take responsibility for their 
own development and took steps to more 
actively monitor and support them in doing 
so.ASML Academy facilitated the soft skills 
needed for an effective Develop & Perform 
program through skills-building workshops 
and training courses for employees and 
managers throughout the year related to 
topics such as coaching, development 
conversations, and giving and receiving 
feedback.
We introduced development and 
performance reviews outside the HR&O 
system for ASML Berlin GmbH senior 
management level and above, with the 
expectation to widen this scope to include 
levels within middle management in the 
following year.
In 2024, we ran a pilot of the Integrated 
Talent Management (ITM) program for a 
select group of job profiles (approximately 
1,500 employees). The ITM program aims to 
support our growth by engaging, developing 
and retaining employees – by offering the 
best possible career development. It 
enhances the foundation for our career 
development journey by enriching our job 
architecture with pre-filled job profiles and 
skills, connecting it to skills-based learning 
and offering employees a range of 
development opportunities – such as 
mentorships and career paths based on their 
personal profile and interests. The pilot is 
meant to test the new concepts and 
solutions, collect user feedback and 
establish how best to embed it in existing

employees is compared to the adequate wage 
benchmark.
ASML lowest wage:  ASML lowest wage consists 
of an annual basic wage at a full-time equivalent 
basis and fixed payments that are guaranteed to 
employees at the time of the assessment.Adequate wage benchmark:  The adequate 
wage benchmark is based on the higher of the 
most recent minimum and living wage (lower- 
bound guidance thresholds) per location. The 
most recent thresholds are sourced from a 
reputable independent third party.

We stimulate research on breakthrough 
technologies that will enable the UN SDGs. 
We provide (in-kind) support to ESG-
focused startups, scaleups and tech funds, 
such as HighTech XL, DeepTechXL, Make 
Next and several venture capital funds, 
providing promising startup and scaleup 
companies with access to highly qualified 
resources, technologies, licenses, supply 
chain partners and co-investors. The scope 
of our (potential) investments is global.
ESG-focused research is currently focused 
on the Van Gogh IMPASTO project.
We continue to build our ESG-focused 
platforms, partnerships and collaborations

Targets and performance
We have defined three targets in supporting 
startups, scaleups and tech funds:
Support 14 ESG-focused scaleup 
companies by 2025 
In 2024, we provided 5,360  hours of in-kind 
support, totaling €1.3 million . In addition to 
our prior commitments of over €20 million, in 
2024, we committed a further €12.5 million  
in financial support. 
So far, 13 ESG-focused scaleups have been 
supported by the Make Next Platform. 
In 2024 we further developed the program 
to better suit the needs of the scaleups and 
to improve the impact of our support, for 
example by adapting our coaching programs 
to improve impact. Achieve more than 20% ESG-focused 
startups reaching ‘star level’ by 2025
HighTechXL, as a venture builder and 
startup accelerator, has focused since 2000 
on its venture-building activity. In 2024, 14%  
of startups reached star level – defined as 
those accelerated HighTechXL startups 
showing a multiple of investment above 10. 
The target of 20% of ESG-focused startups 
to achieve star level by 2025 is not on track. 
Originally, this target was set when 
HighTechXL was still a startup accelerator. 
However, in 2020, this was transformed into 
a venture-building program. We have seen 
that it generally takes longer for these newly 
established startups to mature. Additionally, 
the focus is now on deep tech, which 
typically requires a longer time to develop. In 
2025, revised targets to align to the updated 
program will be discussed.Achieve more than €4.0 billion  in global 
R&D invested by 2025
In the context of overall innovation – which 
includes ESG-focused research – our goal is 
to achieve more than €4.0 billion  spent in 
global R&D by 2025. In 2024, we invested 
€4.3 billion . In the base year 2019, we 
invested €2.0 billion  in R&D.

Protecting Van Gogh’s artistic heritage 
Vincent van Gogh continues to inspire 
millions of people all over the world thanks 
to his revolutionary use of light and color. 
With our shared links to the Dutch province 
of Brabant and Van Gogh’s clear focus on 
light and innovation, ASML has always had 
an affinity with his work – and we are now 
using our expertise to help Van Gogh 
Brabant and the Van Gogh Museum (VGM) 
to protect his heritage.
In June 2024, we concluded the first phase 
of our five-year collaboration with the VGM. 
Our IMPASTO project aims to assess the 
status of Van Gogh’s masterworks and to 
look at methods on how to optimally study 
and conserve them. The University of 
Amsterdam (UvA), the Rijksdienst voor 
Cultureel Erfgoed (RCE) and the Technical 
University Eindhoven (TU/e) are active 
partners in this collaboration – each bringing 
unique skills and competencies.
We have defined and executed against four 
main pillars:
•Paint degradation studies (executed 
mostly at VGM and RCE): The original 
pigments used by Van Gogh are recreated 
and the deterioration of the paints studied. 
This project will lead to two PhDs 
sponsored by ASML•Measurement tools (executed mostly at 
ASML): Several measurement tools are 
being developed at ASML to help learn

Our scope
We aim to help increase the technical talent 
pool that ASML, our suppliers and 
customers, and society at large need to 
solve some of society's toughest challenges.
STEM students are a key target group for 
our talent pipeline, both on vocational and 
academic levels. Our talent engagement 
efforts are directed at students who are 
enrolled in colleges and universities, to 
support them to become thriving tech 
professionals. Talent Acquisition leads a 
talent engagement and university strategy to

===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

we take responsibility for creating social 
cohesion in the region by facilitating positive 
interactions between cultures.
In 2024, we introduced the following key 
activities to bring together local and 
international members of the Brainport 
Eindhoven community:
ASML x Brabant C
Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we are 
investing approximately €2 million in the new 
ASML x Brabant C cultural partnership to 
facilitate an expanded and inclusive cultural 
offering in the region. The partnership offers 
professional culture-makers an opportunity 
to develop new initiatives accessible to 
everyone. Some of these initiatives include 
the Storioni Festival, Glow, Stichting 
Wildpark, Crafts Film Festival, Next Nature 
Networks and Dutch Silent Film Festival.      
De Schalm Theatre, Veldhoven
In our new partnership with Theater de 
Schalm, the new exciting Veldhoven events 
will emphasize the international character of 
Veldhoven. We aim to make theater visits 
more accessible by opening the venue’s 
doors to a broader and younger audience. 
All children up to 12 years old can attend 
youth and family performances for free. 
Over the coming years, we will scale up our


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

collaboration to create more social cohesion 
across people from all age groups and 
backgrounds. Our goal for this ongoing initiative is to reach everyone in the 
Veldhoven community through multiple 
cultural initiatives throughout the year.
Buddy system for internationals
In 2024, to help create more interactions 
between locals and internationals, our pilot 
project with Cordaad links 20 international 
families with a local ‘buddy’. The buddies 
help the families to integrate, and answer the 
day-to-day questions they might have.


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

of our growth and further contribute to social 
cohesion in the community:
Effenaar music venue, Eindhoven
We strengthened our collaboration with the 
Effenaar, with the aim of bringing more 
popular and international artists to 
Eindhoven in the coming years. As well as 
concerts at the venue, we expanded the 
annual Hit The City music festival held in 
various locations around the city. In 2024, 
the line-up consisted of more than 100 acts 
and attracted around 31,500 people.ASML Summer Games (ASML Zomerspelen)  
Over 1,200 children and teenagers joined the 
first edition of the ASML Summer Games in 
2024. Organized with BrabantSport and 
many local partners, to increase access and 
connect young people through sports, the 
program offered 24 different free sports 
clinics to local 6-to-18 year-olds, targeting 
families with fewer resources as well as 
young people with different care needs. 
We involved 34 sports clubs and provided 
60 children with sports gear for the clinics.  
On average, each participant discovered five 
new sports. Our partners are linking families 
to the right resources to ensure that the 
children are given every opportunity, even 
if there is not enough money at home.
Partnership with Muziekgebouw Eindhoven  
We have a long-term partnership with the 
Muziekgebouw Eindhoven, the main concert 
hall in the city. We invite the best musical 
and artistic talents from among our own 
employees to take to the stage at the venue 
once a year at our ASML on Stage event.
Other activities we’ve been 
involved in:
ASML Marathon Eindhoven: The 40th 
edition of the ASML Marathon Eindhoven, 
with 38,000 runners from around the world. 
Over 3,300 ASML employees took part in 
the various races. As the title partner, we 
covered the entry costs for 500 local 
residents with limited resources, as well 
as for all our employee runners. Van Gogh museum:  In Brabant, we 
increased access to the Van Gogh Village 
Museum in Nuenen by making entry free 
for all children under 18. 
GLOW Light Art Festival:  We were a 
partner and sponsor of the annual GLOW 
Light Art in Eindhoven, displaying the 
works of famous national and international 
light artists throughout the city center. 
In 2024, around several hundred thousand 
people visited the festival.
Drop of Light exhibit and experience 
lab: At the 2024 Taiwan Lantern Festival, 
we presented our ‘Drop of Light’ exhibit, 
as well as an experience lab to learn more

member with a serious health condition, or bond

weeks of paid family care leave in a 12-month period.We understand the additional responsibilities faced 
by working parents at KLA. In many of our global 
locations, we support new mothers with postpartum 
care and lactation rooms. Parents can also receive 
paid leave to manage childcare, on-demand webinars 
covering challenges in the parenting journey 
and support while they navigate a return to the 
workforce.
KLA believes in the importance of a harmonious 
life that balances work and personal time, and we 
support our employees through flexible work models 
that meet both their needs and the company’s 
business goals and objectives. Employees in roles 
deemed flexible work in a hybrid model, and 
employees in certain positions may request part-time 
schedules. We consciously raise awareness around 
scheduling challenges that sometimes affect our 
global teams, so that employees in certain time zones 
don’t face unrealistic expectations and negative 
impacts. Employees who are required to work on-site 
daily have opportunities to take time off and the 
flexibility to work off-site when circumstances permit.Despite our commitment to flexible work models, 
KLA continues to believe in the importance of 
welcoming facilities where our people can come 
together to collaborate, push toward goals and build 
community. Since 2019, we’ve invested significantly 
in our worldwide facilities. Our new second North 
American headquarters facility in Ann Arbor, Artificial

Sustaining Social and Workplace Well-Being
KLA believes in the importance of a harmonious life that balances work and personal time, and we back up that belief through flexible work models and 
paid leave support. Employees in roles deemed flexible work in a hybrid model, and employees required to work on-site daily can request off-site days 
and time off when circumstances permit. Employees in certain positions may also request to work part-time schedules. To avoid unrealistic expectations 
and negative impacts on our global team members, we stress awareness when scheduling meetings across multiple time zones.
To help our workforce balance the demands of work and family, we offer support that includes paid leave to handle elder care or childcare, tend to family 
members with serious health needs, or bond with a child following birth, adoption or foster placement. All U.S. employees are eligible for paid family care 
leave annually. To help address the needs of working parents, we offer on-demand webinars covering challenges in the parenting journey and support to 
help navigate a return to the workforce. Many of our global locations also offer new mothers postpartum care and access to lactation rooms. 
Along with our commitment to flexible work models, KLA also continues to believe in the importance of creating welcoming facilities where our people 
can come together to collaborate, innovate, push toward goals and build community. In 2024, we introduced three new global, virtual manager trainings

students and candidates face institutional, social, and

fields and advance. At Lam, we believe it’s time for that to 
change, so we use our resources, reach, and leadership 
position to move the needle. We collaborate with universities 
and academic organizations to provide internships, fund 
fellowships, and support our recruitment goals, in addition to 
sponsoring and attending key industry events to amplify and 
recruit diverse STEM professionals. 
Our 2022 activities included attending AfroTech’s annual 
conference, which brings together Black entrepreneurs and 
innovators. Internally, our Talent Acquisition team piloted 
a new centralized talent-sourcing model in the U.S., which 
emphasizes outreach to diverse candidates and includes a

building activities include: 
U.S. university collaborations
In 2022, we continued our collaboration with the United 
Negro College Fund (UNCF) for the second year. Lam 
provided $100,000 to fund 20 scholarships at UNCF 
schools, including historically Black colleges and 
universities (HBCUs). We also launched new alumni  
and student recruiting relationships including:
 •Georgia Institute of Technology 
 •National Society of Black Engineers 
 •Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers 
 •Spelman College U.S. academic internships and fellowships
Lam serves as a key partner for the National Consortium of 
Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering (GEM), which 
provides graduate-level fellowships to underrepresented 
candidates in engineering and science. In 2022, we 
provided $460,000 to enable 20 GEM fellowships—up from 
13 fellowships in 2021. GEM also provides its fellows with

exceptional results. To promote equitable opportunities in our industry, we work to engage talent from groups who have historically faced social barriers to entry into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. 
We took a key step by implementing a tool created to optimize the talent acquisition and management process. The tool enables us to consider candidates for all roles in which they qualify, supplying us with more opportunities to match candidates to our company’s hiring needs and increasing candidate satisfaction.
In addition, we implemented new technology to create a faster application process and thereby improve the candidate experience. 
Promoting equity and representation through  industry events
To promote a more equitable STEM landscape, we participate in events throughout the year that align with our diversity and inclusion values. Examples of our activities in 2023 include:
 •Sponsoring the Diversity in Tech Symposium, a virtual event organized through the University of California’s EDGE in Tech Initiative. The theme of this year’s symposium was “Smarter Tech for a Resilient Future,” and it included a panel on advanced manufacturing, featuring Lam Chemical Engineer Xueying Zhao. 
 •Sponsoring and participating in HBCU Engage, an in-person forum aimed at enhancing partnerships and forging new collaborations with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The 2023 event included more than 173 organizations, such as industry, government, and nonprofit institutions.
 •Participating in WE23, the world’s largest conference for women in engineering and technology. The 2023 conference convened more than 21,600 women engineers, aspiring engineers, and allies through in-person events and virtual sessions viewed around the world. 
 •Sponsoring the executive welcome reception at AFROTECH
™, the largest Black tech conference in the U.S., 
to help drive increased representation of Black individuals in STEM. The conference brought together a global community of innovators for a week of big ideas, tech innovation, networking, recruitment, and more.
Supporting diverse students and scholars 
Great employees begin as driven students and scholars looking for opportunities to gain new experiences, connections, and skills. We support them by providing funding for academic scholarships and fellowships, with a focus on delivering opportunities to those who have historically been underrepresented in STEM careers. For example, Lam has long been a key partner for the National Consortium of Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering (GEM), which provides graduate-level fellowships to underrepresented candidates in engineering and science. GEM also provides its fellows with exposure to industry internship programs, including our own, and we were proud to welcome 13 GEM fellows as part of our intern cohort during the year. We also embarked on the third year of our collaboration with the United Negro College Fund and continued our support for FIRST Global. Lam hosted a panel discussion on building 
women leaders with HerKey, India’s largest career engagement platform for women. The panel included women leaders with a decade or more of experience, who shared candid insights on navigating the path to leadership excellence. Key topics included the importance of resilience, balancing motherhood with professional careers, taking a break with intent, and continuously working toward future growth.

each region faces specific social challenges. Lam has offices across multiple continents, so it’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. We feel a responsibility to make a positive impact where our employees live and work. In addition to targeted financial donations, we encourage employees to volunteer their time.
Lam completed the first year of its sponsorship 
of FIRST Global. How has that initiative supported your engagement efforts?
When we launch a signature initiative, it’s all hands on deck. 
An important piece of that is employee engagement. In 2023, over 60 employees volunteered through the initiative. That included 32 employees who served in a skills-based capacity, spending several months mentoring teams of high-school students from places including Cambodia, Eritrea, and Nicaragua as they built robots for the competition. The 2023 FIRST Global Challenge was held near our Singapore office, so many local employees gave their time to support students coming to the competition from all over the world. The growth of Lam’s community 
engagement efforts is impressive. How have you worked to get more teams in more regions involved?
Our Lam Cares ambassador program has been key to our 
growth. We have an internal network of champions across locations and business units who plan events and engage local team members. We have also up-leveled our annual volunteer campaigns. They’re such a fun opportunity to engage, and we’re seeing organic growth from folks who don’t want to miss out!
What is next as you continue to build 
toward your 2025 goals?
We look forward to strengthening our partnerships with 
Lam’s ERGs to amplify their community engagement initiatives, identifying and building relationships with community partners, and driving even more internal engagement. This is part of our ongoing efforts to raise awareness of our community engagement initiatives, which are an important part of how we live our Core Values and strengthen Lam’s culture.
