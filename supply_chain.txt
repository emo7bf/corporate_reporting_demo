Supply Chain head and Chief Information 
Security Officer and is managed by a cross-
functional team encompassing Global Supply 
Chain, AGS Commodity Business Management, 
Global Information Security, Information 
Security Risk Management, the Legal and 
Compliance Organization, and Global Sourcing 
and Procurement. 
As part of the program, we engage suppliers 
during the onboarding process and subsequently 
on a risk and need basis for high-impact 
suppliers. In fiscal 2024, Applied completed its 
first on-site cybersecurity audit with one of our 
top 15 suppliers. 
Applied is a member of the SEMI Manufacturing 
Cybersecurity Consortium and holds the  
chair position for three of the seven working


===== reports | Applied Materials | 2024 Applied Materials Impact Report =====

groups, including Supply Chain Cybersecurity 
and Industry Standards. In 2024, the 
Consortium developed a draft of a standard

world’s largest and most advanced facility for 
collaborative semiconductor process technology 
and manufacturing equipment R&D, the EPIC Center  
in California’s Silicon Valley. The EPIC Center is the 
heart of a high-velocity innovation platform designed 
to accelerate development and commercialization of 
the foundational technologies needed by the global 
semiconductor and computing industries, and is 
designed to be capable of engaging in public-private 
collaborative efforts.
In November 2024, a $100 million U.S. federal 
research investment for advanced packaging 
technologies was announced. Applied is working 
in collaboration with others to develop and scale

All the New College Graduate programs provide 
hands-on experience to put theories into practice 
and build professional skills, including teamwork 
and communication. Throughout the program, 
new college graduates gain an understanding of 
Applied’s culture, values and mission, and have 
opportunities to engage with executive leadership 
within their organization. 
 
Applied offers a wide range of internship 
positions across the globe for qualified students 
in both technical and business areas. Intern 
experiences in the U.S., Europe and Asia range in 
length from two to five months and are supported 
with deep business engagement.  
In 2024, Applied strengthened our internship 
program to help students better understand the 
semiconductor industry and their role in it.
Apprenticeships 
 
Applied has a strong and growing apprenticeship 
program. We expanded our U.S. Department 
of Labor-registered apprenticeship program 
from two groups in 2023 to four groups in 
2024. The program, provided in collaboration 
with government entities, colleges and other 
companies, supports the development of 
technical talent for the semiconductor industry.  
The program is open to all applicants. Program 
participants come from a variety of backgrounds, 
experiences and perspectives.
In November 2024, the first class of assemblers 
graduated from the program, and in December 
2024, the first class of process technicians 
graduated after completing two years of college 
course work and on-the-job training with 
mentors and managers.  
Building on the success of the program in the 
U.S., Applied plans to expand the apprenticeship 
program to Taiwan in 2025.U.S. Military and Veterans 
Applied has a strong record as a destination 
employer for U.S. veterans. Veterans bring 
a unique combination of experience, skills, 
leadership and discipline that enables them to 
thrive in the dynamic semiconductor industry.  
Each year, the number of veterans employed at 
Applied grows, yet there are opportunities to 
attract an even larger share of this skilled talent 
pool to our company and industry. To this end, 
we are expanding our veteran outreach efforts.  
Further, Applied is now certified by the U.S. 
Department of Defense SkillBridge program 
to host current active-duty military service 
members in civilian positions so that they may 
gain civilian work experience before they leave 
active duty. We anticipate hosting active-duty 
military service members in 2025.  
In 2024, Applied was recognized as Vet Friendly 
by U.S. Veterans Magazine , ranked as a Best for 
Vets 2024 Employer by Military Times , received 
a Bronze Award from Military Friendly® and is a 
Recognized Employer from VETS Indexes.

• Supply Chain ResponsibilityPay Fairness  
Applied is committed to compensating 
our employees fairly. To that end, we have 
structured our compensation program so that 
employees’ pay is based on relevant factors, 
such as employment role, organizational 
level and geographic location, and not on 
demographics.
To confirm that we live up to this goal of 
fair pay, we have engaged an independent 
third party to calculate pay ratios comparing 
compensation for Applied employees, both 
globally and in the U.S.  In each instance, the 
ratio is based on total compensation, which 
reflects the sum of an employee’s base salary, 
any cash bonus and any stock award. The ratios 
compare compensation for employees who 
were in a similar role, level and location for 
fiscal 2024:
• Total compensation for women globally was 
99% of total compensation for men.
• Total compensation for women in the U.S. was 
100% of total compensation for men.
• Total compensation for racial or ethnic 
minorities in the U.S. was 101% of total 
compensation for non-minorities.
We will continue monitoring our compensation

some of our supply chain partners to deliver 
according to our agreed plans due to 
material shortages have combined to cause 
significant turbulence and meant that we 
were unable to give our customers what they 
needed all of the time. Ultimately, we have seen the global chip 
shortage that first appeared in 2020 continue 
through 2022. We have all encountered this in 
one way or another in our personal lives, 
whether through delays in taking ownership of a 
new vehicle or reduced availability of technology 
such as solar panels.

to respond quickly and appropriately to the 
current waves of uncertainty.
…and on our ESG strategy
The theme for this annual report is Small 
patterns. Big impact. The things we do at 
ASML have a wide-ranging impact, not only 
on our customers but on society at large. 
The technology pioneered by our R&D teams 
and partners sits at the heart of global 
digitalization, and has the potential to 
transform how we all live and work, from


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

post-COVID-19 supply chain constraints, 
inflationary pressures and risk of a 
global recession. 
The big picture for our sector continues to be 
dominated by the global shortage of 
semiconductors. With its ability to transform 
how we all live and work, digital technology 
sits at the heart of the macroeconomic 
landscape. Expanding application space and 
relentless innovation are expected to 
continue to fuel growth across 
semiconductor markets. Industry sources 
anticipate annual growth rates of 9% and 
more than a doubling of semiconductor 
revenue from 2020 to 2030.However, while the medium- and long-term 
outlook and trends remain unchanged, the


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

The issues that restricted the supply chain 
during and after the pandemic surges of 
2020 and 2021 are beginning to abate, and 
we are scaling up for capacity increases. 
With additional global demand for wafers 
expected to be over 780,000 wafer starts 
per month per year in 2030, we plan to 
increase our annual capacity to 90 EUV 0.33 
NA and 600 DUV systems (2025-2026), 
while also ramping up EUV 0.55 NA (High-
NA) capacity to 20 systems per year 
(2027-2028).Trends affecting our marketplace
The following are some of the major 
themes and trends driving our industry’s 
development, both today and tomorrow.

as DUV. To address materials shortages, we 
are significantly expanding capacity together


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

with our supply chain partners, although 
these shortages have already led to the late 
start of the assembly of a number of 
systems. As our tools are in high demand, 
our customers are frequently requesting fast 
shipments. A fast shipment process skips 
some of the testing in our factory. Final 
testing and formal acceptance then takes 
place at the customer site. This leads to a 
delay of revenue recognition for those 
shipments until formal customer acceptance, 
but does provide our customers with earlier 
access to wafer output capacity.
Additionally, I would like to highlight that 
safety is at the heart of our business. While 
we did not encounter any ASML work-
related fatalities, regrettably two contracted 
workers had a fatal accident on ASML 
premises in Wilton in 2022. We are doing 
everything we can to minimize this risk and 
are working proactively at all levels to deliver 
on our mission to ensure injury-free and 
healthy working conditions.Are the current financial uncertainties 
affecting capital investment plans?

global semiconductor supply chain is 
properly assessed. Given the timelines and 
current market situation, we do not expect 
these measures to have a material effect on

wavelengths. To achieve this, we and our supply chain 
partners are actively adding and improving capacity to 
meet future customer demand. 
At our November 2022 Investor Day, also known as 
Capital Markets Day (CMD), we presented our upward 
revised long-term growth opportunity for 2025 as well as 
2030. We remodeled our previous sales scenarios in a 
low and high market due to the rapid evolution of end-
market technology growth drivers technological 
sovereignty and foundry competition projects since our 
update in 2021. Based on the different market scenarios, we believe we 
have an opportunity to reach annual sales of between 
approximately €30 billion and €40 billion in 2025, with a 
gross margin between approximately 54% and 56%.
Looking further ahead, for 2030 we believe we have an 
opportunity to reach annual sales of between 
approximately €44 billion and €60 billion, with a gross 
margin between approximately 56% and 60%.
The main additional demand drivers behind the upward 
adjustments of our scenarios are the market-driven 
growth in both advanced and mature markets,

===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

supply chain constraints.
– Hiring, onboarding and retaining the workforce in the current competitive market is increasingly challenging. Consistent pressure on our

– The high demand we are continuing to experience could change customers’ sourcing strategies to become less dependent on ASML.


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

– Optimization of supply chain footprint– Geopolitical tensions are rising and additional export control restrictions have been imposed during 2022. The risk of further restrictions on 
exports or investments is high, and as a consequence global trade is shifting from globalization to regionalization as China, US and many 
other countries strive for technological sovereignty. In particular, the tensions between China and the US may lead to a decoupled ecosystem


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

and – in the longer term – overcapacity. Given the important role both countries play in the semiconductor supply chain, this can have a 
significant impact on our industry. Trade and export barriers have already impacted our ability to sell to and service systems for certain 
customers, and this is likely to continue to impact our business going forward.

How we manage risk (continued)
 
The risk factors below are classified under 
these six risk types. Any of these risks and 
events or circumstances described therein 
may have a material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition, results of 
operations and reputation. These risks are 
not the only ones that we face. Some risks 
may not yet be known to us, and certain 
risks that we do not currently believe to be 
material could become material in the 
future.  
Many of these risks may be intensified by 
global events such as the COVID-19 
pandemic (including the China Zero-COVID 
policy), the Russia–Ukraine conflict, 
inflation, global measures taken in 
response to these events and any 
worsening of the associated global

Risk category: Supply chain disruption, Supplier strategy and performance
We rely on outside vendors for components and 
subassemblies used in our systems, including the 
design thereof. These components and subassemblies 
are obtained from a single supplier or a limited number 
of suppliers. As our business has grown, our 
dependence on single suppliers or a limited number of 
suppliers has grown, because the highly specialized 
nature of many of our components, particularly for 
EUV including 0.55 NA systems, means it is not 
economical to source from more than one supplier. 
Our sourcing strategy therefore (in many cases) 
prescribes ‘single sourcing, dual competence’. Our 
reliance on a limited group of suppliers involves several 
risks, including a potential inability to obtain an 
adequate supply of required components or 
subassemblies in time and at acceptable costs, and 
reduced control over pricing and quality. Delays in 
supply of these components and subassemblies, 
which could occur for a variety of reasons, such as 
disruptions experienced by our suppliers, including


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

our supply chain, resulting in a late start on the 
assembly of a number of systems. In addition, due to 
high demand, we reduced cycle time in our factory to 
ship more systems. We have achieved this through a 
fast shipment process that skips some of the testing in 
our factory. Final testing and formal acceptance then 
takes place at the customer site. This provides our 
customers with earlier access to wafer output capacity 
but also leads to a delay of revenue recognition for 
those shipments until formal customer acceptance. We 
and our suppliers are investing in additional capacity to 
meet the demand. However, increasing capacity takes 
time, and we may be unable to meet the full demand of 
our customers for a few years. Further, we face the risk 
that demand may not continue to increase, which could 
result in overcapacity and loss of investment in 
increasing capacity.In addition, most of our key suppliers, including Carl 
Zeiss SMT GmbH, have a limited number of 
manufacturing facilities, the disruption of which may 
significantly and adversely affect our production 
capacity.
Lead times in obtaining components have increased as


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

our end-to-end supply chain to meet this demand, but 
we face challenges in increasing capacity. For 
example, in order to increase our capacity, we depend 
on our suppliers increasing their capacity, and it takes 
time to build the production space and equipment


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

required for expansion. We and our supply chain also 
need to obtain permits to make expansion possible; 
these may not be (timely) granted.
It is a challenge for ASML and our suppliers to hire and 
retain more employees in the current competitive labor

supply chain (either to the original module suppliers or to 
ASML). Our goal is to standardize these processes and 
create a network-related solution to enable high flexibility 
and reduce transport, which also reduces our CO2e 
footprint.
We are improving the re-use of packaging, locking and 
transport materials from the field and factory, and aim to 
return and re-use 80% or more in the next installation or 
relocation. Local repair centers
We are extending the number of local repair centers for 
refurbishing, repairing or cleaning service parts, 
packaging and tools, and we are setting up global repair 
centers for factory materials. The value handled by our 
local repair centers increased fourfold in 2022, and we 
expect it will increase three times again in 2023. Our goal 
for 2025 is that 10% of our parts sent to the field should 
be repaired locally.
Currently we have local repair centers in South Korea 
and China, and we are rolling out plans for all our 
customer regions to eventually have one or more in 
place. A global repair center has been opened in Linkou 
and additional global repair centers will be established at 
each of our factory hubs in Wilton and San Diego (US) 
and Veldhoven (the Netherlands).
Our repair centers partner with local material suppliers 
and specialized repair partners, creating a local 
ecosystem. By enabling repair and re-use activities and 
taking ownership of repairs in the field close to our 
customers, we are able to reduce logistics time, the 
costs of stocking parts and our environmental impact (by

Our approach
Supplier performance management
To help us manage ASML’s growth and our future 
ambitions, we continue to improve our key business 
processes. Tight risk control and continuous supply 
chain improvement are key to ensuring quality, long-term


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

or reduce those risks.Supply chain risk management
Due to the highly specialized nature of many of our parts 
and modules, as well as the low volume, it is not always 
economical to source from more than one supplier. In 
many instances, our sourcing strategy therefore 
prescribes ‘single sourcing, dual competence’, which 
requires us to proactively manage supplier performance 
and risk.
In our risk management framework, we assess six risk 
domains – calamity, ownership, finance, intellectual 
property ownership, information security and 
compliance. Since suppliers operating in the same 
industry or market are typically exposed to similar risks, 
we evaluate suppliers’ risk and performance within the 
context of their supply market category. We will adjust 
our category strategies where required to meet ASML’s 
short- and long-term business needs. In cases where 
risk exceeds the agreed threshold, mitigation measures 
are taken. For example, we have long-term supplier 
agreements (LTSAs) and/or continuous supply 
agreements in place, or ensure the availability of 
intellectual property in escrow.

Risk - How we manage risk.Our performance and actions in 2022
We conduct continuous performance and risk 
management of our supply base to assuring and 
improving performance, and preventing reputational 
damage. Two key programs to this process: a suppliers' 
business continuity program aimed at securing continuity 
of supply and suppliers’ information security; and an 
information security and cyber resilience program 
intended to protect our intellectual property and maintain 
our leading technology position.
Business continuity program
In 2022, we continued to focus on improving business 
recovery capabilities, carrying out a review of business 
continuity plans for reassurance that suppliers can re-
establish deliveries within the shortest possible time 
frame in case a disruptive event occurs. We require 
suppliers to have business recovery capabilities in line 
with the ISO 22301 standard. Supplier recovery plans are 
requested, evaluated and, where needed, improved to 
prevent potential business disruptions. For example, 
suppliers might be required to store their inventory in 
separate locations, implement fire prevention controls or 
increase buffer stock. In 2022, we included 235

We see ourselves as architects and integrators, working 
with partners in an innovation ecosystem. Our focus is on 
innovating through partnerships, and in our innovation 
ecosystem, long-term collaboration is based on trust. By 
sharing our expertise with the ecosystem, we build a 
strong knowledge network capable of creating 
technological solutions that society can tap into. We 
share both risk and reward, and this collaborative 
approach allows us to accelerate innovation. 
We focus on collaboration with research centers, fueling 
the innovation pipeline through partnerships with 
academia and research institutes, and collaboration with 
R&D partners through EU public–private partnerships. 
We also believe that we can create greater impact in the 
ecosystem by nurturing future young tech through 
support for startups and scaleups.

and scaling up manufacturing. DeepTechXL originates 
from and will work closely with HighTechXL.ASML is also one of the main shareholders of HighTechXL, 
together with other tech-minded partners in the region such 
as Philips, TNO, BOM and High Tech Campus Eindhoven. 
Through HighTechXL, we build and accelerate impactful 
startups by combining high-tech entrepreneurial talent and 
relevant technologies from reputable tech partners such as 
ESA, CERN, Fraunhofer, imec and TNO, with the goal of 
solving major global societal challenges. Selected ASML 
talents join these startups for 30% of their time for a period 
of three months. They define their learning goals and typically 
benefit from both enriched skills and mindsets after this 
entrepreneurial experience.
To date, over 20 new deep-tech ventures have 
completed the program and some are already receiving 
global attention. Moreover, several new ventures are 
currently still in the accelerator program, making good 
progress, and new cohorts are already planned.
Action plans for 2022-2025
We are on track to support 14 new scaleup projects by 
2025 and to meet our R&D investment targets. However, 
the target of 20% of startups to achieve Star level by 
2025 may take longer than originally expected. This 
target was first set when HighTechXL was still a 
traditional startup accelerator, but since it was 
transformed into a venture building program, we have 
seen that it generally takes longer for these newly 
established startups to mature. Additionally, the focus is 
now on deep-tech, which typically requires a longer time 
to develop. A discussion on defining a more applicable 
target reflecting the new situation is ongoing.inPhocal makes first sale after two years as HighTechXL 
Venture Building Program alumnus
In 2020, a group of enthusiastic founders set course on a 
journey to start inPhocal, a deep-tech company based 
on an optical technology that originated from the CERN 
institute, where it was originally developed for long-
distance alignment of equipment in their Large Hadron 
Collider (LHC) experiment. 
Within the nine-months HighTechXL venture building 
program, inPhocal was given the chance to pick 
technologies from several top-class institutes and 
companies, such as ASML, the European Space 
Agency, Philips and TNO, and to develop themselves 
into a mature company. As part of this program, inPhocal 
discovered the potential of their unique technology for 
laser processing, which provides a laser beam with a 
long focus depth – this means the focus does not have 
to be adjusted when marking curved objects or cutting 
through thick materials, which results in unprecedented 
improvements in speed and efficiency. Market research 
proved that their technology could indeed solve current 
problems and their technology quickly gained the interest 
of several large companies, such as Heineken, Coca-
Cola, Pepsico, AbInBev and Logitech.
We are on track to support 14 new scaleup 
projects by 2025.In the meantime, inPhocal developed a functional

commitments to address and engage actively in our 
salient human rights issues are highlighted in our Code of

We assess risks related to human rights in our supply 
chain through a risk-based approach. In our due

Platform to identify inherent risks in labor (including 
human rights), ethics, health and safety and  
environmental standards across our full supply base. 
In the event that a medium or high risk relating to labor is 
identified, we engage with the supplier and conduct a 
more detailed analysis. For strategic suppliers covering


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

In our supply chain network, we use a single model for 
risk assessment of our partners, which they also use in 
order to screen their suppliers. We are also in close 
contact with peers, partners and best-in-class security 
solution providers, and our security solutions are tested 
regularly through penetration testing (ethical hacking) to 
identify exploitable issues so that effective security 
controls can be implemented. 
Given the continuous trend of increasing cyber and 
security risk and the increasing geopolitical attention towards ASML, we are continuously reviewing the 
adequacy of our risk control framework and continue to 
implement additional controls. However, given the 
pervasiveness, sophistication and rapid rise of 
cybersecurity and other security risks, the geopolitical 
attention towards the semiconductor industry and the 
inherent limitations that follow from our collaborative 
innovation approach, this may not always be sufficient to 
prevent an incident, and reduce this risk entirely. Hence a 
relentless drive is required and in place to adopt the 
latest best practices.

Risk - How we manage risk.
Creating Security Circles of Trust
At ASML, we develop our technology in close 
collaboration with partners inside and outside our 
company in an innovation ecosystem based on 
trust. Innovating and collaborating in a connected 
ecosystem requires secure information sharing 
beyond corporate boundaries, as the vulnerability to 
cyberattacks is extended to the perimeter of the 
total ecosystem.
Therefore, in 2021 ASML started the Security 
Circles of Trust initiative to protect our innovation 
ecosystem in the Brainport Eindhoven region and 
the Netherlands. The ‘circle of trust’ is a network of 
peers and suppliers who jointly embrace the same 
information security standards and raise their 
performance against these standards. The network 
also drives the exchange of knowledge and best 
practices between ASML, suppliers and ecosystem 
partners.We share best practices to help our innovation 
partners develop and reinforce security maturity. 
The goals are to protect intellectual property and 
guard the industry and the region against 
cybercrime such as ransomware, to share relevant 
threat intelligence, to collaborate on security topics 
and to become more secure together. Annually we 
hold master classes with our top 10 key suppliers 
and more than 50 of our neighbor companies to 
increase information security awareness and 
knowledge in the region, and to share practical tips,

supply chain issues, 2022 has been another record year 
for our company. Driven by continuing strong demand for 
microchips, we currently enjoy the fullest order book in 
our history – and we are in a very good position to 
achieve further growth in the years to come.
As a supervisory Board we are of course very pleased 
with these achievements that only could be realized 
thanks to our highly engaged workforce that always went 
the extra mile required. We are satisfied, but not 
complacent. The high market demand, especially for 
DUV, took us by surprise and our systems and supply 
chain issues did not allow us to meet all our customer 
requirements.
In order to maintain our success we are working hard to 
prepare for the future. Below, I outline some of the key 
areas that we focused on during 2022.
Reviewing our capacity plans
The last 12 months again saw unprecedented demand 
for semiconductors, both in mature as well as leading 
edge technology, resulting in the fullest order book in our 
history. This against a backdrop of a declining global 
economic growth, driven by geopolitical tensions – 
including the war in Ukraine as well as legacy issues 
associated with COVID-19 - with resulting high inflation


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

supply chain with the required flexibility to cope with 
market volatility.
The Supervisory Board also discussed in detail with 
management the actions required to meet the short term 
demand of our customers. Although we could not supply 
all that we were asked to deliver, we ensured that our 
teams did everything possible to help our customers 
continue to meet the demands of their customers. For 
example, our fast shipments initiative reduced throughput 
time and increased output by having some final testing 
and formal acceptance carried out on customer sites 
instead of at our own facilities.
Organizing for continued growth
Reviewing our priorities for continued growth, we 
confirmed that our current core business presents by far 
the biggest opportunity. This requires a further 
strengthening of our partnerships with certain key 
suppliers, where we are making good progress.  In 
addition, we see interesting opportunities in adjacent 
holistic lithography markets that we will further explore. 
We strive to foster a unified culture at ASML based on 
our values of challenge, collaborate and care. Making the 
impossible possible and always trying to reach the 
cutting edge of what is technically doable are core 
characteristics of our company. However, ASML’s rapid 
growth presents significant challenges for our way of 
working, our people and our managerial capacity and


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

as our Supply Chain Management.
In addition, as a Supervisory Board, we maintained a 
strong focus on Management development and 
succession planning. We are working hard together with 
the Board of Management to identify and develop the 
talent we need to ensure that we have qualified 
successors both in middle- and senior-management to 
deliver continued growth and meet market demands for 
cutting edge lithography solutions.

innovation ecosystem and the supply chain. Overarching


===== reports | ASML | 2022 ASML Annual Report =====

make the supply chain more robust and resilient.
Our visits to internal functions including the 5L 
Warehouse project and the High NA factory gave us a 
good insights into the expertise we have at ASML and 
delivered valuable learnings on further improvement 
required. l We also visited one of our key technology 
partners, the Advanced Research Center for 
Nanolithography (ARCNL), where we were impressed by 
their depth of technical capability.
In addition a delegation of the Supervisory Board 
regularly meets with the Works Council in order to better 
understand the needs and concerns of our people. 
Although our thoughts are usually closely aligned with 
those of the Works Council, we ensure that we engage 
directly with them to provide a clear communications 
channel to the feelings of people across our organization.Also Members of the Supervisory Board regularly meet 
with institutional investors. For instance, the Chair of our 
Remuneration Committee frequently engages with major 
investors to ensure that the Remuneration Policy is 
closely aligned with their expectations. 
Looking ahead
The Supervisory Board is confident that the full order 
book – supported by the skills and passion of our 
outstanding teams – lays a firm foundation for the 
months and years ahead. While geopolitical matters, 
likely mild recession and the aftermath of COVID-19 will

continue to hamper efforts to ensure the supply chain 
runs smoothly, ASML is well placed to achieve another 
excellent performance in 2023.
At the 2023 AGM, Rolf-Dieter Schwalb and I will step 
down after having served on ASML's Supervisory Board 
for eight years. On behalf of the Supervisory Board I 
would like to express gratitude to Rolf-Dieter for his 
important contribution to the Supervisory Board, 
especially as Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
previously also as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee.During our 8 years on the Board, we were part of a 
fantastic journey that saw ASML grow with the 
breakthrough of EUV from a 6 billion revenue company in 
2014 to a 21 billion Company in 2022, driven by absolute 
customer focus, technological prowess and an 
unbelievably strong “can do” mentality. The journey will 
continue under our successors. For us it was a pleasure 
and a privilege to serve.
To close, on behalf of the whole Supervisory Board I 
would once again like to thank every member of our 
39,086-strong team for their hard work and sheer 
enthusiasm throughout 2022.You made it happen!

Management in 2022, due to the impact of supply chain 
issues and inflation on the STI score, and due to a lower 
number of granted shares at issuance date for the 
2020-2022 LTI plan. In 2022, the remuneration of the 
employees was adjusted for CLA and merit increases in 
2022. Furthermore, in addition to normalizing the STI 
score for fast shipments, the 2022 STI score for 
employees was also adjusted for the impact of supply 
chain issues and inflation in 2022, which is reflected in 
the 2022 US GAAP figures. ASML intends to grant 
competitive remuneration to employees at all position 
levels within the Company. At each level remuneration 
should reflect the responsibilities of the role. The build-up 
of remuneration from level to level should therefore be 
gradual and in line with increasing responsibilities, also 
following market practice. At the highest level the steps 
become gradually bigger as responsibilities ultimately rise 
from a divisional level to an overall company level. The 
Supervisory Board considers the current build-up and 
the overall pay ratio of 34:1 to be equitable, considering 
the current performance of the company.

This resulted in a supply chain correction in 
2023 which impacted our industry. 
In the context of demand for lithography, 
some customers delayed the timing of their 
demand for specific systems, as some of 
their facilities were not ready to receive the 
systems as well as a result of their end 
demand. This provided an opportunity to 
allocate these systems to customers whose 
demand profile we could not initially meet. 
Despite these delays, for certain system 
types the supply is still the main constraint, 
with demand being higher than supply, 
albeit at a reduced level than was 
experienced at the start of the year.All in all, global trends – such as generative

its most advanced DUV immersion 
lithography systems (TWINSCAN NXT:2000i 
and subsequent immersion systems) as well 
as US licenses for mature systems for a

provide further details to the company on any 
conditions that apply. From January 1, 2024, 
we will work with our customers to deliver 
the non-advanced lithography systems

Supply chain disruption, Supplier strategy and performance
We rely on outside vendors for components and subassemblies 
used in our systems, including the design thereof. These 
components and subassemblies are obtained from a single supplier 
or a limited number of suppliers. As our business has grown, our 
dependence on single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers has 
grown. The highly specialized nature of many of our components, 
particularly for EUV systems, means it is not economical to source 
from more than one supplier. In many cases, our sourcing strategy 
prescribes ‘single sourcing, dual competence’. Our reliance on a 
limited group of suppliers involves several risks, including a potential 
inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components or 
subassemblies in time and at acceptable costs, and reduced 
control over pricing and quality. Delays in supply of these 
components and subassemblies could occur due to disruptions 
experienced by our suppliers for reasons including work stoppages,


===== reports | ASML | 2023 ASML Annual Report =====

shortages in our supply chain, resulting in a late start on the 
assembly of a number of systems. We and our suppliers are 
investing in additional capacity to meet the demand. However, 
increasing capacity takes time, and we may be unable to meet the 
full demand of our customers for a few years. Further, we face the 
risk that demand may decrease, which could result in overcapacity 
and loss of investment in increasing capacity. In addition, most of 
our key suppliers, including Carl Zeiss SMT, have a limited number 
of manufacturing facilities, the disruption of which may significantly 
and adversely affect our production capacity.Lead times in obtaining components have increased as our

production capacity in our end-to-end supply chain to meet 
demand, but we face challenges in increasing capacity. For 
example, we depend on our suppliers increasing their capacity and 
their ability to invest, and it takes time to build the production space


===== reports | ASML | 2023 ASML Annual Report =====

and equipment required for expansion. We and our supply chain 
also need to obtain permits to make expansion possible, and the 
time it takes for these to be granted may cause delays. It is a challenge for ASML and its suppliers to hire and retain  
employees to support expansion. Our processes and systems and

that of our supply chain may also not be able to adequately support 
our growth. If we are not successful in increasing our capacity to 
meet demand, this could impact our relationships with customers 
and our competitive position. The increased demand and resultant 
supply constraints that we are continuing to experience lead to 
longer lead times for customers. This could result in customers 
changing their sourcing strategy to become less dependent on

A significant portion of our GHG emissions are


===== reports | ASML | 2023 ASML Annual Report =====

generated indirectly in our supply chain, as we 
mainly assemble modules that we source from 
suppliers. Parts and modules have to be 
transported to us or our customers directly, and 
our assembled systems are shipped from ASML 
premises to customers. As today’s freight 
logistics, especially air transportation, are still 
carbon-intensive, a significant part of our supply 
chain emissions stem from logistics (operated 
by our logistics suppliers).

How we’re managing 
our impact
We are using the following  levers, aiming to reduce our 
impact:
•Business travel: Reducing the volume of business 
travel through stricter policies, raising awareness and 
use of remote working and servicing option s.
•Commuting : To reduce the percentage of car commutes  
in our Veldhoven region (NL), we focus on developing a 
mix of sustainable commuting options by encouraging 
people to travel to work by bicycle or p ublic transport . 
Alongside this, we provide shuttle bus services from 
Park & Ride locations, offer  satellite offices and 
promote a balanced working-from-home policy. 
Our targets and performance 
in 2023
Our target is to achieve net zero emissions from business 
travel and commuting by 2025.
In 2023, taking into account Sustainable Aviation Fuel 
(SAF) purchases, our total emissions due to business 
travel and commuting were 70 kt  CO2e and 54 kt CO2e, 
respectively (see graphs). Due to the increasing number 
of employees at all locations and the ending of COVID-19 
travel restrictions, our emissions increa sed by 13% 
compared to 2022 (69 kt CO2e and 41 kt CO2e, 
respectively ). Commuting emissions are predominantly 
related to commuting by car. The impact of the indirect

have visibility of their own supply chain emissions. To 
support them, we have introduced an IT dashboard that 
will capture and display the re levant dat a.
In 2023, we made progress by requesting CO2e 
emissions data directly from our suppliers through our

processes and create a network-related solution to 
enable high flexibility and reduce transport, which also 
reduces our CO2e footprint.
We are improving the reuse of packaging, lockings  and

GHG  emissions i n our supply chain by 20 30We have reorganized our sourcing and supply chain 
organization, which is now known as Sourcing &

understand their capabilities and work with them to build 
and improve our shared opportunities. We are working to 
focus the efforts of our S&P organization through clear 
interfaces and ways of working with our suppliers and

or reduce those risks.Supply chain risk management
Due to the highly specialized nature of many of our parts 
and modules, as well as the low volumes, it is not always 
economical to source from more than one supplier. In 
many instances, our sourcing strategy prescribes ‘single 
sourcing, dual competence’, which requires us to 
proactively manage supplier performance and risk.
In our risk management framework, we assess six risk 
domains – business continuity management, ownership, 
finance, intellectual property ownership, information 
security and cyber resilience, and compliance. Since 
suppliers operating in the same industry or market are 
typically exposed to similar risks, we evaluate suppliers’ 
risk and performance within the context of their supply 
market category. We adjust our category strategies 
where required to meet ASML’s short- and long-term 
business needs. In cases where risk exceeds the agreed 
threshold, mitigation measures are taken. For example, 
we have long-term supplier agreements (LTSAs) and/or 
continuous supply agreements in place and we ensure 
the availability of intellectual property in escrow.

We conduct robust performance and risk management 
of our supply base to assure and improve performance 
and prevent business disruption and reputational 
damage. Two key programs are central to our approach: 
the suppliers' business continuity program is aimed at 
securing continuity of supply ; and the information

Additionally, we utilize a cyber-risk monitoring tool to 
monitor the internet presence of suppliers – in 2023, we 
extended its scope from 256 to 469 suppliers.
Suppliers with access to top-secret information or with 
privileged access to our IT systems were asked to 
improve their cyber resilience through the ISO 27001 
standard. To support our suppliers and other ecosystem 
partners in this effort, we established a Security Circle of

in 2023
We have two targets to measure the effectiveness of our 
approach:
1More than 20% of startups to reach Star level by 
2025
2Support (at least) 14 scaleup companies by 2025
In 2023, we continued our commitment to support high-
tech startups and scaleups, providing 4,640  hours  of in-
kind support, totaling €1.2 million . In addition to last 
year's  commitment of over €14 million, we committed an 
additional €6 million in financial support in 2023. Of this 
€20 million commitment, €2.9 million was paid out during 
the year. 12% of startups reached Star level.  So far,  13 
scaleups have been adopted, including three in 2023.

To reinforce our commitment across the supply chain, 
we expect suppliers and their suppliers to acknowledge 
and comply with the RBA Code of Conduct and to 
develop their own strategies, policies and processes to 
uphold it. This requirement is included in our long-term

Rights at Work and the UN Declaration of Human Rights, 
the UN Global Compact and the principles specified in 
the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises , as 
well as other relevant standards such as the UN 
Women’s Empowerment Principles, UNICEF’s Children’s

supply chain and downstream. We are examining the extent 
to which negative impacts identified have been, or are being, 
caused by ASML and whether ASML has contributed to 
these, or whether its activities are linked to identified impacts.
The saliency assessment will support  the prioritization of 
impacts based on the saliency (i.e. the scope, scale and 
irremediability) of the harm, the nature of ASML's causal 
contribution and, where ASML has not caused or 
contributed to the harm but is directly linked to it, the 
extent to which ASML has created, or can create, 
leverage to effect change in the wrongful practices of 
another party that is causing or contributing to the 
negative impact. Where feasible, we will engage with 
relevant external stakeholders – such as suppliers,  NGO s 
and other legitimate representatives – to help us 
understand the nature and extent of the impact and the 
ways in which we can address it.
This provides guidance to the organization on the steps 
we take to address negative impacts, depending on the 
kind of impact or risk identified. Our assessment aims to 
construct  a system of consequences  – setting out the 
steps to be taken, following a risk-based approach, to 
address and mitigate human rights impacts and risks – 
that will help us determine how we manage salient 
impacts over time.

Yet despite the pressures and uncertainties which have 
seen the semiconductor industry move into a cyclical 
trough, ASML has delivered a sales increase of 30% over 
the previous year, with a gross  margin of 51.3%  – and 
the prospects for the years ahead appear to be positive 
and sustained.
On a personal level, it has been both inspirational and a 
privilege to lead the Supervisory Board of one of the 
world’s most important tech companies. ASML is 
strategically significant, not only to the Netherlands, but 
also to Europe in a wider context. The company is a real 
locomotive in developing and strengthening the 
European technology scene, through precision 
manufacturing as well as semiconductor research.
Before my career in business, I was drawn to engineering 
and have long been fascinated by the potential of 
technology to transform lives for the better. In addition, 
through my experience at other multinational companies 
I’ve developed a keen interest in both macroeconomics 
and global politics. My role on the Supervisory Board at 
ASML brings together those interests at a time when 
technology has assumed even greater importance in 
people’s lives and has become a hot topic on the 
agendas of political leaders worldwide.Working with the Board of Management
The Supervisory Board is a diverse group of individuals 
with enormous experience – not only in technology and 
manufacturing, which are of course extremely relevant to 
ASML, but also in broader fields. Besides our formal 
meetings, our nine members take part in many additional 
ad hoc meetings. 
Together, we have the appropriate knowledge and skill 
sets to guide management on a wide range of issues 
including geopolitical matters. Our role is not to run the 
company, but to provide oversight, evaluate performance 
and give advice where required or requested. One of the 
Chair’s key responsibilities is to create a ‘safe space’ 
where discussion can take place freely and openly. 
Mutual trust and respect are absolutely central here – 
management has to be confident that we are a valuable 
sounding board, and in turn we have to trust 
management to take heed of our advice, focus on the 
right things and work towards viable solutions. In the 
short period of time that I have been in position, I have 
seen that the relationship is working well and that we 
share a vision of the challenges and opportunities facing 
ASML.
The following pages of this report provide detail on the 
areas of focus that we concentrated on during the year, 
one of which being ESG, which is an increasingly key 
matter for all companies. In recognition of the importance 
of ESG, we established ASML’s ESG Committee in 
2023, headed by Birgit Conix. This committee has been

sourcing and supply chain organization was transformed 
with the aim of optimizing our partnerships with our suppliers 
in order to ensure the required flexibility and capability to be 
able to meet our customer demand for the short and long-
term. In the area of customer trust, a transformation was 
prepared, aimed at ASML's customer facing roles and 
responsibilities, to prepare for future growth and enable 
further improvements in customer trust .
Supervisory Board focus in  2023
Throughout 2023, the Supervisory Board agenda was 
centered around the strategy and its execution, financial and 
operational performance, business developments , risk 
management, and people and organization. Based on the 
strategic priorities for ASML as agreed in the annual strategy review, several topics were extensively discussed by means 
of deep dives, allowing a focused and in-depth review.
Strategy and sustainable long-term value creation
The Supervisory Board devoted a considerable amount 
of time in 2023 to discussing strategic topics. We carried 
out our recurring annual review of ASML’s corporate 
strategy, the long-term financial plan and the long-term 
plans of ASML's business and operational sectors. 
During the annual strategy review, the Supervisory Board 
confirmed its support for the general strategic direction 
and discussed what the key strategic challenges, focus 
areas for further strategy development, are. The 
Supervisory Board provided their perspectives on topics 
such as dependency on suppliers, cost and flexibility, 
future technology and innovation roadmap, installed base 
services, global footprint. The Supervisory Board 
concluded that it fully supports ASML’s strategy, which is 
centered around the four pillars: 1. Grow our holistic


===== reports | ASML | 2023 ASML Annual Report =====

lithography business; 2. Secure unique supply chain 
capabilities to ensure business continuity; 3. Move 
toward adjacent business opportunities; and 4. Deliver


===== reports | ASML | 2023 ASML Annual Report =====

Customer Trust, Robust Supply Chain, and Integrated 
Operating Model, ASML's value strategy and service 
business model and the mature lithography market.
With global trends expected to continue fuelling 
semiconductor growth long-term driving an increasing 
demand for wafers and ASML continuing to focus on the 
execution of its strategic priorities, the Supervisory Board 
has confidence in ASML’s long-term growth opportunities


===== reports | ASML | 2023 ASML Annual Report =====

Robust Supply Chain, and Integrated Operating Model. 
Ample time was spent by the Supervisory Board 
discussing these programs in open dialogues with the 
Board of Management, during which the Supervisory 
Board challenged and advised the Board of 
Management on how to organize for the future expected 
growth towards 2030. The Supervisory Board is pleased


===== reports | ASML | 2023 ASML Annual Report =====

with the strengthening of our supply chain resilience as 
well as with the reorganization of ASML's customer- 
facing organization, which will be implemented in 2024.
People and organization
Given the significant growth of ASML in recent years, the 
topics of people and organization continued to be key areas 
of focus for the Supervisory Board in 2023, as we believe 
that these are of critical importance for the future success of 
ASML. On several occasions, we were provided with updates on Human Resources and Organization. Topics 
covered included the People Strategy, the progress made 
on the ASML leadership program, the results of the annual 
employee engagement survey and Diversity & Inclusion. 
Specific attention was also paid to ASML's culture and 
values the focus of the Supervisory Board was how to 
maintain the culture that has made ASML successful while 
growing so fast in number of employees. We also extensively 
discussed the organizational setup of ASML in the context of 
current and future growth and we reviewed the progress of 
the transformation programs related to Customer Trust,


===== reports | ASML | 2023 ASML Annual Report =====

Robust Supply Chain and Future Operating Model. As a 
result of this discussion, the Supervisory Board decided to 
position the role of the Executive Vice President and Chief 
Customer Officer in the Board of Management, as 
announced by press release on November 30, 2023. 
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board, assisted by the 
Selection and Nomination Committee, extensively discussed 
and provided advice in respect of ASML’s talent 
management and people development programs as well as 
succession planning for the Board of Management and 
senior management. The Supervisory Board is pleased to 
see the effort being put into the onboarding of new 
employees, enabling them to develop and contribute as

Supply chain disruption, Supplier strategy and performance
We rely on third-party vendors for components and subassemblies 
used in our systems, including the design thereof. These 
components and subassemblies are obtained from a single 
supplier or a limited number of suppliers. As our business has 
grown, our dependence on single suppliers or a limited number of 
suppliers has grown. The highly specialized nature of many of our 
components, particularly for EUV systems, means it is not 
economical to source from more than one supplier. In many cases, 
our sourcing strategy prescribes ‘single sourcing, dual 
competence’. Our reliance on a limited group of suppliers involves 
several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate 
supply of required components or subassemblies in time and at 
acceptable costs, and reduced control over pricing and quality. 
Delays in supply of these components and subassemblies could 
occur due to disruptions experienced by our suppliers for reasons


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

end supply chain to meet expected demand, but we face 
challenges in increasing capacity. For example, we depend on our 
suppliers increasing their capacity and their ability to invest, and it 
takes time to build the production space and equipment required


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

for expansion. We and our supply chain also need to obtain 
permits to make expansion possible, and the time it takes for these 
to be granted may cause delays.  
 It is a challenge for ASML and its suppliers to hire and retain 
employees to support expansion. Our processes and systems


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

and those of our supply chain may also not be able to adequately 
support our growth. If we are not successful in increasing our 
capacity to meet expected demand, this could impact our 
relationships with customers and our competitive position.
We and our suppliers have invested significantly in increasing 
capacity, and we face various risks in connection with this, 
including risks relating to system quality, the risk that we have not 
accurately predicted demand, and risks associated with maintaining 
a much larger production infrastructure and supplier ecosystem, 
including higher costs and challenges in controlling the enlarged 
production process.
We also face the risk that our increase in capacity could result 
in capacity that exceeds demand (overcapacity). 
 Hazardous substances are used in the production and operation of


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

standards throughout our supply chain. 
We actively engage in initiatives that support 
employee well-being and community 
development, fostering a culture of respect. 
We rely heavily on the skills, commitment 
and behavior of employees across our 
organization. It is only through their actions 
that we can build the trust and respect we

===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

Manufacturing stages of the supply chain
In the manufacturing stages (typically our 
direct suppliers and the first tiers beyond 
Tier 1), we see higher risks in two key areas:
Electronic components and boards: Due to 
the fact that the electronics manufacturing 
industry is extremely dynamic, requiring the 
industry to be flexible. This tends to result in 
lower value-adding, labor-intensive, less 
advanced economies, low-skilled 
workforces and lower labor cost, all adding 
up to an increased risk of labor exploitation. 
Specifically, we identified the following 
salient topics:
•Occupational health and safety, excessive 
overtime and lack of freedom of 
association
•Child and student labor, particularly in the 
electronics industry
•Forced labor in electronics manufacturing 
in certain countries.

Q:Why was it important to 
discuss scope 3 
emissions in our supply 
chain with the ESG 
Committee?
Wayne Allan:  ASML’s ambition is to become 
greenhouse gas neutral for scope 3 upstream supply 
chain emissions by 2030. Our aim was for the ESG 
Committee to understand and support the plan and 
actions defined by ASML’s Strategic Sourcing & 
Procurement team, also because a performance 
target related to this topic was introduced as an LTI 
metric in 2024.   
Q:Can you provide more color to what was 
discussed with the ESG Committee?
Wayne Allan:  We explained how we plan to obtain 
emission reduction commitments from our tier 1 
suppliers and to identify key decarbonization levers 
beyond these tier 1 suppliers. We also focused on 
opportunities for cross-company and cross-industry 
collaboration. In this context, the initiatives related to

Within the supply chain, our related 
emissions have increased compared to the 
2019 baseline, primarily caused by our 
growth and accompanying spend. As we 
have calculated our emissions based on

back into the supply chain – either to the 
original module suppliers or to ASML. 
Our goal is to standardize these processes 
and create a network-related solution to 
enable high flexibility and reduce transport, 
which also reduces our CO2e footprint.
These activities – which are under 
development globally and connected to our 
general enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
system – support us in maintaining a parts 
return rate of 95% and a recondition rate of 
95%. 
On an annual basis, the additional potential 
savings related to these activities amount to 
€1.5 billion worth of materials. Localized repair centers
Currently, we have repair centers in Asia 
(South Korea, Taiwan and China), the US 
(Wilton, San Diego, Vancouver WA) and the 
EU (Veldhoven), which work with local 
suppliers and specialized repair partners to 
create a local ecosystem. By enabling repair 
and reuse activities and taking ownership of 
repairs close to where materials are needed, 
we are able to reduce logistics time, cost of 
stocking parts and our environmental impact 
(by reducing both scrap and GHG 
emissions).
In 2024 we opened our new Reuse Work 
Center in Newtown, Connecticut (US). With 
this dedicated facility for reuse and repair 
activities, our Wilton (US) factory greatly 
increased its reuse capacity and efficiency. 
The Newtown Reuse Work Center features 
its own 2,500 ft2 cleanroom, including a 
grade-four area for dismantling particularly 
sensitive modules (such as YieldStar 
sensors and EUV uniformity correction 
modules), a warehouse and logistics 
facilities. A dedicated team of production 
engineers, technicians and logistics experts 
drives disassembly, repairs and upgrades of 
modules and will be taking many more parts 
from the Wilton factory, including DUV 
reticle stages, Z-mirrors, YieldStar sensors 
and EUV uniformity correction modules. Improving the effectiveness of the reuse 
flow
In 2024 we began improving the data 
availability of materials flow and registration 
in our ERP system.
In our new system designs, we aim to 
ensure design-for-reuse principles. 
The related training and detailed 
documentation have been tested and rolled 
out in 2024 and will be continued in 2025.
To track the effectiveness of our reuse flow 
actions, we constantly measure the return-
to-recondition flow, the recondition-to-good-
stock flow and the reuse rate, and we also 
monitor the inventory levels of materials to 
be reconditioned.
Circular supplier collaboration
We are collaborating with suppliers to 
incentivize reuse over new purchases. 
We have started transferring used parts 
back to our suppliers to repair, refurbish 
or harvest for reuse in their new buying 
process, giving them more flexibility in 
how they can reuse parts. In the prior year, 
we investigated how to support a new 
collaboration model with suppliers for 
reusing materials, as well as how to adjust


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

back into the supply chain as separate 
parts. This approach provides greater 
availability of materials, reduced cost and 
lower lead times, particularly for lenses in 
high demand. We have also completed a 
pilot to include XT main bodies in this 
process.Resources
We have a dedicated Reuse & Repair 
organization. While in the beginning cost 
was the main purpose of reuse, other key


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

Our approach aligns with their expectations regarding

===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

impacts.For impacts arising in the supply chain, we 
track progress via SAQs of suppliers, our 
third-party risk management process and 
RBA audits (including tracking progress on 
corrective action plans). 
For actual impacts identified via our 
grievance mechanism (Speak Up Service) – 
or other channels like the National Contact 
Points for the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises – follow-up is 
tracked via our Speak Up Service.
We periodically review the implementation 
progress of our due diligence processes and 
outcomes achieved to identify trends and 
areas of improvement – the outcomes of 
which are communicated with senior 
leadership.

supply chain (step 2 of our environmental 
and human rights due diligence framework 
in How we’re managing).
It is our policy to discuss all high-risk 
findings with the supplier to evaluate the risk 
and determine if an improvement plan is 
needed. When the result of the SAQ scores 
is high-risk, we request the supplier to 
elaborate on their responses and/or answer 
follow-up questions. In case the high risk 
remains after further evaluation and 
clarifications with the suppliers, we work 
with the supplier to define an action plan to 
close the high-risk areas.
During regular table meetings we track and 
assess both the proportion of suppliers who 
have completed the RBA SAQ and the 
progress made on the high risks evaluated 
and related follow-up activities.

conditions of armed conflict and/or serious human rights abuses.
We have adopted a series of compliance measures based on the legal requirements and 
guidelines of the five-step framework set out by the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

This is due to several reasons: 3TG supply chain complexity, the number of tiers of 
suppliers to trace the source, and the limited number of certified conflict-free smelters


===== reports | ASML | 2024 Annual Report based on IFRS =====

Keep Looking AheadExpanding Supply Chain Inclusion & Diversity
We assist our partners through our Supplier Inclusion & Diversity website . New suppliers are encouraged to voluntarily 
notify KLA if they meet any of the recognized “diverse supplier” categories listed on our webpage, such as women-owned 
businesses or businesses owned by individuals from underrepresented groups, including minority, veteran and LGBTQ+ 
suppliers. This information will be used to show a more accurate representation of our current supplier base.
As a corporate member of the Western Regional Minority Supplier Development Council  (WRMSDC), we have access to


===== reports | KLA | 2022 KLA_Global_Impact_Report =====

a network of diverse suppliers and can exchange best practices with peers in improving supply chain I&D. And through 
our participation in the SEMI Manufacturing Ownership Diversity  (MOD) working group, we seek to assist SEMI MOD in 
focusing on the capabilities of diverse suppliers in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.
If a supplier meets any applicable classifications, but has not yet sought certification, that supplier can promptly seek 
certification from a local or state government certifying agency, as well as regional or national minority and women’s 
business councils. For questions on how to obtain certification, please refer to our website. 
 
Discrimination is not tolerated at KLA or with our suppliers. Further, KLA expects its suppliers will not discriminate within


===== reports | KLA | 2022 KLA_Global_Impact_Report =====

their supply chain practices. Suppliers are expected to be transparent and not discriminate on the basis of race, color, 
national origin, ancestry, religion, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions), gender identity, 
gender expression, sexual orientation, marital or familial status, age, disability, genetic information, medical condition 
(cancer and genetic characteristics), veteran or military status, status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or

KLA strives to build an inclusive supply chain, and we recognize that 
partnering with a broad range of suppliers is fundamental to the 
company’s continued success. In our sourcing and purchasing activities, 
we seek out a variety of suppliers whose goods and services meet KLA’s 
standards, supplier selection criteria and customer requirements. 
The Supplier Inclusion & Diversity  page of our website encourages 
potential new certified suppliers to notify KLA if they meet any of the 
recognized categories listed in our Supplier Diversity Classifications Guide. 
We maintain memberships with organizations that focus on the growth of 
our supplier base. In 2023, we gave supplier managers access to a third-
party database to search for potential diverse suppliers that may meet 
KLA's needs and stringent standards.
We also continued our engagement with the  Western Regional Minority 
Supplier Development Council  (WRMSDC) and the SEMI Manufacturing 
Ownership Diversity  (MOD) working group. As a recognized Bronze-level 
corporate member of the WRMSDC, KLA shares best practices aimed 
at building more inclusive supply chains. We also support WRMSDC’s 
mission to expand business education and develop business development 
scholarships. Through SEMI-MOD, we participate in efforts focusing on

===== reports | KLA | 2024-KLA-Global-Impact-Report =====

KLA’s supply chain management (SCM) program works toward continuous improvement throughout the KLA product 
lifecycle and supplier relationship, communicating our expectations and providing guidance to our suppliers. For supplier 
managers, category managers and buyers, our cross-functional selection and qualification process includes guidance on 
required deliverables, supplier engagement and performance improvement for direct suppliers. Similarly, our Sourcing 
Guidelines provide guidance regarding new and existing indirect suppliers.
Through our tiering process for direct suppliers, we create required scorecard reviews that track changes in a supplier’s 
overall performance across both business metrics and ESG issues, including country-specific risks, commodity-specific risks,

Annually, KLA assesses the risk of forced labor in our supply chain by leveraging the RBA SAQ process. The SAQ addresses topics such as recruitment practices, employment contracts, freedom 
of movement, retention of personal documents, and working conditions to help identify risks related to forced labor. KLA enforces our human rights policies through contractual supplier 
requirements and ongoing supplier relationship management. We also provide internal training on preventing human trafficking and slavery to select KLA employees based on their job function.

APPENDIXReducing Supply Chain Carbon Impacts
Building technologies and efficiencies that can drive down carbon impacts has to be a shared endeavor across the 
value chain. Since purchased goods and services (PGS) comprise a significant percentage of KLA’s overall Scope 3

footprint, we engage directly with key supply chain partners (as defined by their share of our PGS emissions) to

reduce that footprint, align our supply chain on common goals and enhance overall transparency.
KLA made progress in engaging our suppliers on carbon reduction in 2024, growing the number of suppliers involved

in response rate, outpacing the CDP’s average response rate for North America supply chain members. Our SBTi 
efforts also gained traction, with the percentage of targeted suppliers that have set science-based targets rising from 
15% in 2023 to 22% in 2024. By incorporating the additional data from these improvements into our inventory, we 
gain a more precise understanding of our emissions. For more information on how collected data was integrated,

suppliers and sites to comply with laws including—but not 
limited to—the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and the 
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010.
Lam published its first Human Rights Policy  in 2022, which 
outlines our expectations to uphold internationally recognized 
human rights. This policy applies to all employees and we 
expect our suppliers, as well as our business and community 
partners, to adopt similar practices. The policy aligns with 
the RBA’s Code of Conduct and builds on expectations 
outlined in our GSCC. Additionally, our Global Employment  
Practices Statement  declares our support of workers’ rights 
to freedom of association and collective bargaining, to the 
extent permitted under local laws. These documents are

Our current human rights management process is built on the RBA framework. It leverages our annual completion of self-assessment questionnaires (SAQs), together with participation in RBA's Validated Assessment Program (VAP) to drive continuous improvement. The SAQs cover labor, ethics, health and safety, environmental stewardship, and management systems. Leveraging third-party management systems allows us to monitor our operations and supply chain for potential human rights-related risks. In 2023, an internal cross-functional team completed SAQs for all Lam sites with significant manufacturing operations, each of which received a low-risk score. We also received a Platinum score on the RBA VAP closure audit at our Livermore, California, facility.
If a risk is identified through our SAQ process, Lam has mitigation systems in place to document, track, and address those risks.
Following the adoption of our Human Rights Policy in 2022, we reviewed our business and operational practices to identify opportunities to implement a human rights program. The assessment used existing human rights frameworks from the UN and RBA to assess human rights practices and policies across the majority of our manufacturing sites and at the corporate level. We identified the following activities as key areas of opportunity: increasing employee awareness of human rights issues, continuing to expand and deepen third-party due diligence, and establishing clear roles and responsibilities for human rights across the business. These will be areas of focus for our program management in 2024.
THIRD-PARTY MANAGEMENT
Our third-party management pillar focuses on due diligence, controls, and monitoring to identify and mitigate ethics and compliance risks created by Lam and outside parties, such as customers and suppliers. This work begins with screening, risk identification, and evaluation during the selection and onboarding process. It extends throughout the lifespan of our third-party engagements and includes providing support for our business teams and carrying out ongoing monitoring efforts such as risk-based reviews.

Amid an evolving regulatory landscape, our GTGA group works to monitor emerging regulations and engage in policy discussions globally. In 2023, we focused on modernizing our compliance mechanisms to support these ongoing efforts, in line with our broader digital transformation initiative. We also continued our programs directed at compliance with export controls issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to the People's Republic of China.
FORMALIZING THE LAMPAC
The LAMPAC serves as a non-partisan federal political action committee for Lam employees and is dedicated to supporting federal candidates of all political ideologies who are committed to strengthening our nation's semiconductor ecosystem and fostering economic growth. To ensure proper administration of the LAMPAC and maintain compliance with state and federal regulatory requirements, only authorized GTGA personnel may be involved in the making of political contributions by the LAMPAC.
The LAMPAC is registered with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and subject to federal campaign finance laws, including those related to monitoring prohibitions and limitations on donations. Any donations to or from the LAMPAC will be publicly disclosed via the 
FEC’s website . Lam also 
employs external legal counsel to advise the LAMPAC regarding compliance with laws and regulations. In 2023, we established a PPAC comprised of senior executives to provide guidance to the LAMPAC. The PPAC also serves as a venue to consider Lam’s positions on major public policy issues.

• Fostering supply chain diversitySETTING EXPECTATIONS AND PROMOTING PROGRESS
We establish clear expectations at the beginning of the supplier lifecycle to set up both our company and our suppliers for success. Upon selection, we encourage suppliers to become RBA members and contractually require that suppliers adhere to the principles set forth in our 
Global 
Supplier Code of Conduct  (GSCC). In 2023, we updated 
the GSCC to ensure close alignment with the RBA's Code 
of Conduct with reference to globally recognized bodies' guiding documents, such as the United Nations and the International Labor Organization. Throughout the supplier lifecycle, we continue to conduct due diligence using a risk-based approach, while working to facilitate ESG progress.  Our expectations for our top direct suppliers include:

GSCC  and RBA ’s Code of Conduct. Lam’s global Human Rights 
Policy applies to all employees, and we expect our suppliers, as well as our business and community partners, to adopt similar practices. We also expect our suppliers and sites to comply with laws that include, but are not limited to, the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010.

risks within our supply chain. In 2023, we saw a 300% increase in the completion rate of our human rights training by expanding access for employees across our Global Supply Chain Management, E&C, Legal, and Global Trade teams. We also ask our top suppliers to complete RBA’s online human rights module, which helps them flag and appropriately respond to potential risks. Ethically sourcing  
raw materials
The semiconductor industry uses various minerals, including 
conflict minerals such as tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. While Lam does not directly source these minerals, they are present in some items that we purchase from our suppliers. We conduct due diligence in accordance with recognized international standards to determine whether these conflict minerals were sourced from countries associated with conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Lam is a member of the 
RMI, a multi-stakeholder organization that 
helps addr ess human rights issues in the mining of conflict 
minerals and other minerals of concern. We leverage RMI’s Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) for our conflict mineral filings disclosed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.94%

Human rights  in the supply chain
Every individual deserves safe working 
conditions and to be treated with dignity and 
respect. We strive to support and protect 
human rights throughout our global operations,


===== reports | Lam Research | Lam-Research-2024-Global-Impact-Report =====

including within our supply chain. This work 
aligns with our Core Values, our GSCC, and 
our Human Rights Policy, and it supports our 
commitments to our customers.
Lam’s global Human Rights Policy applies to all employees. 
Our GSCC reflects the policy’s principles, and we expect 
our suppliers, as well as our business and community 
partners, to adhere to them. We also expect our suppliers 
and their sites to comply with laws that include, but are 
not limited to, the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and the 
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010.
Our human rights management process is informed by the 
RBA, making use of suppliers’ SAQs and their participation 
in the VAP audits to drive continuous improvement. In 
addition to helping us check compliance with our GSCC 
and the RBA COC, SAQs and review of VAPs ensure our 
suppliers are mitigating potential human rights risks.  The 
management process also helps us meet our customers’
